aS"\nMy My! How clever and original, my Dad dispenses bathroom wisdom with a lot of foul language, It's just the funniest thing, It's so original and new! If you enjoy hanging out in the restroom at interstate rest areas, bars or gas stations you will love this book!\n \n It is touted as a family and fatherhood book of wisdom and humor, any accidental pearl of wisdom contained therein is nullified by the base and gross view of life and women in particular. If you did not get enough of junior high humor, then buy this book. The fact that it is a bestseller is an indicator that our civil and social culture is rapidly spiraling down the drain.  Would you talk to your children in this way? Would you want your children's teachers taking to them in this way? Even sadder still, the cover says it will be adapted for television.\n \n I was asked to review this book for a library.  I read a few pages and thats all it took. Thank God I was not required to buy it. Read something that will elevate your mind, it ain't this book!\n"
p6341
aS'\nJust one example:\n \n "Killing talk radio" is actually reviving the Fairness Doctrine where the media were required to allow alternate points of view.   Ronald Reagan killed this doctrine, allowing guys like Rush Limbaugh to spew their distortions and right wing propaganda nonstop for three hours every day of the week, with no one to challenge them.  Is allowing alternate points of view a bad thing?\n \n Funny how the media is supposedly controlled by the liberals, but it is the conservatives who are so afraid of having alternate points of view.  Don\'t waste your time on this trash.\n'
p6342
aS'\nTwo design flaws render this otherwise fine remote too frustrating to use for controlling Blu-ray (and DVD) movies.\n \n 1. No backlight or glowing keys, so operation in the dark is difficult. This wouldn\'t be a big issue if the buttons were better laid out and had some clues by touch to clarify their functions. But this is a big issue because of flaw #2...\n \n 2. The giant Stop button is positioned between the Play and Pause buttons, and all three are the same large size and shape. It\'s also between the Skip Back and Skip Forward buttons, horizontally, putting it right in the middle of all the most-used buttons.\n \n It takes an impressive level of ineptitude to design a remote like this. Years of R&D on DVD remotes have wisely made Stop buttons smaller than other buttons, and placed them out of the way. Sony seems to have ignored that wisdom. It\'s much too easy to inadvertently tap the PS3 remote\'s large, centrally positioned stop button.  And unlike most DVD players, the PS3 has no "Are you sure you want to stop the disc?" warning, for when you do.  So when you accidentally stop your movie (which you will), it\'s a long and irritating process to find your place again on a Blu-ray disc.  It can take 5 minutes, depending on how many notices, previews, commercials and animated menus you have to get through again (some of which you can\'t skip past). And then you have to find where you were, risking seeing images or chapter titles that give away things you really didn\'t want to know yet. All this wasted time can kill the flow of a movie.\n \n Hopefully there\'s a better remote that works with the PS3... one that was designed by people who test their products in real-world circumstances.\n'
p6343
aS'\nOops, I just channeled negative energy out there. So I will get rubbish back, my bad.\n Actually, what "The Secret" proves, when it comes to the "law of attraction" is true -- stupidity attracts the stupid.\n \n That\'s why stupid secrets generate stupid money. Stupid is as stupid buys ... \n \n Gosh darn. I\'m being negative again. I need to burn me some more DVD\'s...\n \n \n'
p6344
aS'\nThis is a very clever book on developing speed reading.  The author disguised it as a nonfiction account of the "liberal" news media, but as I discovered, if you only read the pages in which the author provides verifiable facts to support his reasoning, then you can finish the book before moving from the library book shelf.  Imagine, two hundred pages in five minutes!  I almost got finger blisters turning the pages so quickly. I learned years ago in college that when reading a non-fiction book, other than, let\'s say, most memoirs, that if the book is without reference materials, a bibliography, or notes that allows the reader to verify the information, then the book is most likely a sham.   "Bias" has zero references that would allow the curious reader to independently authenticate the writer\'s claims.  I also did not notice at least semi-complete transcripts to allow for the writer\'s alleged quotes to be understood in context.  The author is strictly operating on a "trust me" basis.  If that\'s good enough for you, then I have a 70\'s VW to sell you (only driven once, really would I lie!).   Regardless of your political orientation, the author should desire an intelligent audience.  By stating his views as proven facts, the author violates the trust given by his audience to treat them with intellectual respect.  Another book, "What Liberal Media?  The Truth About Bias and the News" by Eric Alterman, actually considers the accusations of the Bias author and finds the claims lacking substance.  Sure, Alterman is a liberal, but he gives a full forty pages of references (roughly a fifth of the Bias book\'s total pages) to back up his claims, and to allow the reader to look for her/himself.  In sum, if you want to know who is "Biased" consider who is preferring to hide the information vs. who gives it to you to make up your own mind.  I don\'t have to agree with all of Alterman\'s conclusions, but at least he gives me the opportunity to judge the facts on my own.\n'

aS"\nI don't understand why anybody thinks this is at all good.  I'm a sci-fi geek through and through, from all the Star Treks, both BSG's, all the Stargates, Babylon 5 (and it's ill-fated spinoff Crusade), I'm usually cool with anything in space.  But my god.  Ridiculous? Awful? Cause of severe eye-bleeding? I'm not sure how I can really describe this show.  I probably even managed to make it through half the episodes without knowing or caring who was doing what before I gave up and sold it on here to some poor misguided soul. The acting is bad.  So is the writing.  And the western style is absurd.  Why in the H would people redevelop western accents?  Is the medieval British accent making a comeback? The whole thing is just a complete waste of a show.\n"

aS"\nIt's in here somewhere.  With me.  \n \n Woke up this morning to find that my Guardian Angel had shattered.  The inside was slimy and green.  Moments later, heard a skittering sound behind some furniture.  Found that during the night, phone lines had been cut, and all the doors and windows are shut with some kind of Super Glue like substance.  My cell phone has been smashed.  I can't get out.  It didn't cut the cable internet, so I've got online to warn you, don't buy the guarslkdj;al b bbbbbbbbbbbbbb,,,,,,,,,,,wke;lj\n \n feeling better now.  Everything is fine.  I will be sending a Guardian Angel to all of it's friends, family, neighbors, and associates.  All humans must get one.  Five stars.  The most relaxing experience ever.  I will never have another worry ever again after buying this product, and you will feel total fulfillment in service of a force infinitely greater than yourself.  Buy it.  You will never know pain after you feel the slight pinching at the back of your skull.    \n \n"

aS'\nMy 8 year old suffers from life threatening peanut allergies. Until I found this wonderful Soviet Russian made civilian/military gas mask manufactured just for children, my son Herbert spent 95% of his time under a sealed bubble tent at home. This excellent mask has really been a godsend as Herbert is now able to attend school, participate in his favorite sports, go to the movies, enjoy the Cub Scouts, etc. The large filter canister fits easily into the matching haversack which also carries his school books and other supplies. He does complain that the mask is hot and cumbersome but his words are muffled and well, easy to ignore. It is after all in his best interest. He will come to understand when he gets older.\n'

aS"\nTimothy who reviewed this above must have been paid off lol b/c this is without a doubt the worst product i've laid my eyes or fingers on in 10 years of playing guitar.  What's wrong with it? You name it.\n Its slapped together with glue spots all over it.\n The fretboard feels really strange and rough, with a super high action.\n It will NOT stay in tune.  I actually prayed for it to stay in tune and I don't do that often. It actually smells funny, it smells funny!\n Take your money and burn it, you would actually have more fun doing that than playing this god forsaken thing.\n"

aS"\nI am the CEO of a fortune 500 company. Every day I wear the Wolf Sunset shirt underneath my power suit. It's my little secret. It gives me the confidence I need during shareholder meetings and tough negotiations with our Japanese suppliers. Let me tell you, that Yamaguchi is real hardass, and there's no way I would have gotten that price on transistors if I hadn't been infused with both of natures two most powerful sources of energy: the sun and wolves. Incidentally, solar power is fine but if Al Gore wants to be taken seriously he should be out there promoting lupine power.  But I digress:  the important thing is, business is 10% inspiration, 90% perspiration, and 100% wolf sunset shirtspiration. Also, the cotton feels really good gainst my nipples.\n"

aS"\nIt seems half-baked.  It's a bad shooter, bad driver, and the story is blah. Where's the excitement?  Long loading times walking around exploring make it even more boring.  Cut scenes and long loading times before every battle make you want to put the game down after a few deaths.\n \n I get a spaceship!...oh wait, I just point and click on a planet : (\n \n I get a gun!...oh wait, I have to level up instead of just getting better with it : (\n \n There's something exciting I get to do in a city!...oh wait, I have to talk to him, go here, go back, go back to the first place, go back to talk to him, and go back again...Loading...wow I got 10 XP : (\n \n I realize some people like this genre, and overlook its flaws, but a game should make you want to play the game instead having to fantasize about what you think it could be.\n \n \n If I had to say good things about this game, I would say the talking system is innovative, and the idea of exploring planets and shooting the place up is intriguing, but it doesn't quite come through in this game.\n"

aS"\nHaving recently moved into an upscale manufactured housing facility thanks to the luck conveyed upon me by my Three Wolf Moon t-shirt, I stumbled upon the Zubaz pants here at Amazon and decided that these would complement the crisp, confident, and rugged image conveyed by the T-shirt. \n \n Black Zebra naturally, as these are the sartorial equivalent of the red power tie or a navy blazer with bright buttons.  My buddy has an original pair that I always admired.   I should warn that in direct sunlight the high contrast pattern of these pants, if viewed directly, can cause dizziness and disorientation.  That's why I keep my Oakley Blades on a leash around my neck, just in case.\n \n I had just returned to my humble abode from the pheresis donation center when the UPS driver pulled up with my package.  Realizing what was being delivered I grabbed the box, thanked the driver and mostly ran up the five steps to my double wide.\n \n Hopping on one foot while trying to get my acid washed jeans over my boots, I simultaneously opened the box with what pass for my teeth.  As I pulled the silky polyester over my legs I was simultaneously struck by a sense of awe and wonder.  That's when I fell over and nearly knocked myself out on the rear projection television in the living room.\n \n In hindsight I should have realized that this was the first sign of trouble.\n \n After putting the pants on and admiring them for a few hours, I went down to the Wal-Mart to get some scratch and wins.  I went over to Arbys and smoked half a pack of Marlboro Light Menthols down to the filter while I went carefully through the lottery tickets, rubbing each one on the Moon for luck.  After 25 tickets, I hadn't even won $2!!!!!\n \n Perhaps it was the nicotine, perhaps it was the sheer awesomeness of my attire which overwhelmed me, but I didn't realize that this was another sign that things were not altogether correct. \n \n In the next 48 hours I misplaced my keys, lost my job at Waffle House, was rejected by four women I tried to pick up, chipped my remaining front tooth when I botched a flying roundhouse kick breaking up a fight at the roadhouse, and even spilled ketchup on my Three Wolf Moon t-shirt while eating a chili-dog.\n \n To add insult to injury, someone keyed my Camaro.  Three days later I found myself face down in a puddle of my own sick, choking back the tears of a wasted youth.\n \n I don't know how to explain it but the awesome factor of the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt is not in fact multiplied by the Zubaz pants.  It's like Cold Fusion - once you bring two multifarious confidence and testosterone factors into play, the inverse coalition of chronological extremes dipolarizes the original fulcrum.\n \n That is to say, not only do they cancel each other out, you're screwed.\n \n I've burned the pants, bought another Three Wolf Moon T-shirt and even tried the Breakthrough Wolf T-Shirt.\n \n Nothing has restored my Mojo.\n \n Upon quiet reflection I've come to accept my fate.  Don't let this happen to you!\n \n \n Now to settle back for a tall glass of\n \n Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz \n \n You might enjoy it's nourishing and self defense properties as described in my recent review....\n"

aS"\nLet's get one thing straight.  These things are ugly as sin.  I'm not a fashionista or a shoe snob by any means.  I mostly tend towards sneakers, and I own Teva flip-slops.  I care very little for fashions.  Crocks, however, make my eyes bleed just a little whenever I see them.\n \n Yes, they are comfortable.  That does not make it OK to wear them.  Many, many, many other shoes out there are also comfortable and also have the benefit of not being a crime against humanity.  Wearing them with jeans or slacks is twice as bad, and makes baby Jesus cry.  And if there are any hipsters out there considering them, it is also not OK to wear them ironically.\n \n Please.  For the good of all humanity, do not wear these.  Ophthalmologists everywhere will thank you.\n"

aS"\nHow would I describe the plot in Dead in the Family?  Oh, right, there is no plot!  All you'll get is a series of choppy, unpolished storylines mixed with brief appearances from the large number of characters in this book.  Sookie sighing over Eric, Sookie unsure of where she stands with Bill, something or other about Alcide and the werewolves, dealing with a suspicious fairy triplet, and so on and so forth.  None of it serves a purpose.  This is always a problem authors face when they're forced to extend a series once it becomes successful: the overlapping of characters and subplots become so overwhelming that they don't know what to do with them.  Laurell K. Hamilton, Jim Butcher and Kelley Armstrong suffer from the same thing.\n \n It's time for Ms. Harris to put this series to rest.  Now that Alan Ball has adapted this story for the HBO series, I am actually enjoying that more than the books.  All I can do is thank Harris for writing this, for the TV series wouldn't exist if she hadn't started this.  Funny, but when I read her books years before the TV show was even planned, I wouldn't have pictured myself giving up on it.  Unfortunately, it has reached my limit. Now I'm off to watch True Blood.\n"

aS"\nFirst, the audio narrator was UNBEARABLE...She had a small s-lisp that kept jerking me out of the story--which was bad enough without the constant interruption. She gave the main character a sickly sing-song voice and put a STRONG inflection on the last word of each of her sentences. It was maddening! On top of that she talked obnoxious baby-talk to the dogs--Ugh! The hero's charactor was so flat and unemotional while every other character came through like a small child trying to do voices...cringe-worthy.\n  \n Secondly, THE STORY STUNK! It was a boring manual on dog training with a few moments of babbling dialogue about NOTHING. The heroine/hero were bland and rude respectively and together they were totally forgettable. The serial killer was stuck in here and there like an afterthought. The ending was just as unimpressive. I'd rather listen to nails scraped down a chalkboard than have to endure this book again.\n"

aS'\nIf you\'re looking to purchase a scary toy that makes vacuum cleaner sucking sounds and plays the most annoying "arcade like" music, then this is for you. We received this as a gift for my son\'s first birthday - he was honestly scared of this toy for about 2-3 weeks (I think it was the horrible and loud vacuum cleaner sound it makes when you turn it on). I don\'t see any educational value from this toy and after 2-3 weeks of trying it out, we were all relieved when we decided to retire this to the basement.\n'

aS'\nI like good design, lots of features and industrial strength, so when I saw this "full-featured" elegant processor with extras well under $... new, I brought it home and tested it with my favorite Italian batter bread recipe from Bernard Clayton\'s authoritative bread book. This bread takes 35 minutes of kneading with my powerful Kenwood Major mixer, but the Kenwood mixer walks around the counter as it slams the doughball, so I looked forward to Clayton\'s 7-minute Cuisinart kneading time.  The light batter lifted up the blade and allowed seepage all around the bowl before I reached 2/3 of the claimed 6-cups of flour capacity.  It looked like "the blob" was back and about to eat Seattle.  Customer service operator at Cuisinart left me on hold for 10 minutes while she "went to get a blade," then disconnected me.  Second half-hour call got me an operator who wouldn\'t hang up.  She got the blade, confirmed that it does not "snap in place" as the first operator claimed,told me I had to use only Cuisinart bread recipes.  This machine is only 570 watts  -- info missing on the box -- and mine stopped with only 5 cups of flour and 2 cups of water -- well under the 6-cups of flour claimed capacity. Clayton offers adjusted recipes for food processors, but apparently he hadn\'t tested this "gem."  If you want to do various breads, forget the Cuisinart 2011.  If you want to cool your heels while your incompletely mixed bread is rising, try Cuisinart\'s 800 number. Your wish will be granted, but your bread, it will not be so good.\n'

aS'\nIf Tori Spelling ever had anything remotely interesting on her mind (which is debatable), she has now officially run out of thoughts. Her third book "Uncharted TerriTORI" is an exercise in vapidity, in which Spelling disingenuously rambles on about the exact same subjects that her previous books were about -- and honestly, she usually comes across as a spoiled brat playing at being a grown-up.\n \n A lot of her essays are on pretty mundane events -- meeting her hubby\'s understandably bitter ex-wife, the woes of motherhood, family vacations, stress, clinginess towards friends, jury duty, meeting her grandparents, her son\'s first day at school, swine flu, and so on. In the hands of a more self-aware person this wouldn\'t be a problem, but Spelling acts as if she is literally the first person to ever experience these things.\n \n And she rambles about far less mundane things: what meanies the 90210 cast are (according to her, she was the "sweet" one and they should just LOVE her), sex in a hospital bed, overcoming the paparazzi, starring in a reality show, the terrors of staying at a cheap motel, and adopting a pig. Plus, she tries to overcome her aviatophobia by going to a psychic AND a past-life specialist, and tries to cure headaches with voodoo BEFORE consulting a doctor. Only in L.A., people.\n \n "Uncharted TerriTORI" is basically a big puff pastry, filled with air and flakes -- and reading it is a lot like listening to someone nattering about the minutiae of their uninteresting life. Tori Spelling seems to have two modes of thought: either she is desperately trying to convince us that she\'s "just people" or she\'s dissecting mundane events and blowing them WILDLY out of proportion. \n \n So unsurprisingly, a lot of "Uncharted TerriTORI" is painfully boring, as Spelling either does boring stuff or contemplates her own surgically-enhanced navel. The entire book is written in a coyly disingenuous style, with all the boring stuff only broken by moments of unintentionally hilarious melodrama -- just look at the scene where Spelling\'s husband rips out her IV and carries her (soap opera style) through the hospital, yelling for doctors. Who can take that seriously?\n \n Spelling herself doesn\'t come across too well -- she seems pampered, clingy, whiny, and laughably entitled ("Maybe I was born into wealth as punishment for my behavior asn an Egyptian pharoah"). Additionally, her obsession with herself (a whole chapter on TWEETING!) is just painful. And though she spends a LOT of time trying to convince us that her marriage is not "loveless" as the tabloids say, her husband comes across as a manipulative creep who is just tolerating her.\n \n "Uncharted TerriTORI" is an exercise in tedium, similar to dragging yourself across a very long bed of nails -- boring, painful and seemingly never over.\n'

aS'\nMy kidz and I enjoyed this dreadful exercise in predictability and bad acting for all the wrong reasons: We playfully wagered on what actors would say next (and I use that word "actors" very loosely). It\'s full of cliches of all kinds. We would rewind and laugh at the scenes containing Eva Pigford\'s unbelievably horrid acting (please, for God\'s sake, stick to simply being a model!). We\'d pretend to be menaced and afraid by appearances of that definitive "hood" slickster, aka Wayne Brady ("New Jack City\'s" Nino Brown has got nothing on him!!!). And we were amused at how surprisingly weak the basketball scenes were. The on-the-court scenes contained lots of edits and cut-aways that marked staged shots. And for a movie about b\'ball, the court scenes were extremely minimal and unexciting. On a serious note, please observe this theory of mine if you rent this film (for God\'s sake don\'t buy it): Sometimes, being surrounded by bad actors and faced with a bad script can even make a good actor bad. Case in point, Anthony Mackie. He\'s clearly got skills, but he had no business being in this foul of a film! This movie surely falls under the "So bad it\'s good" banner. If you rent it expecting anything else, you will surely be disappointed.\n'

aS"\nI found this movie to be an incredibly stupid incoherent mess of scenes and CGI. I didn't get anything out of this movie except a couple laughs. My main problem is how unrealistic this movie is. In the first place you have Susie Salmon played by Saoirse Ronan who is a gullible girl in whom it's obvious her parents didn't teach her anything because she stupidly follows the neighborhood pedophile played by Stanley Tucci into some makeshift underground room/pedo-shrine where she gets raped and murdered by the psycho. Then it becomes even more disturbing when her soul gets transported to her very own cheesy CGI version of pergatory where she is able to go sledding on top of fake CG snowy mountains, dance like a hippy in front of a fake CG city (I cringed at that part) and she even becomes friends with a random victim of the same pedophile on the other side she then shoots the @#$# with. This movie has a disturbing undertone and sends the wrong message that she is better off being raped and killed just so long as when it's all said and done she can be transported to her own little wonderland of fun.\n \n  The movie then wants you to think that she can help her parents solve her murder but it becomes a useless plot line and nothing really becomes of it. Jack Salmon who is the father of Susie Salmon (played by Mark Wahlberg) basically transforms into a paranoid wreck because of the murder to the point of wanting the police to randomly investigate hundreds of people/neighbors on suspicion of murder without one single shred of proof. As if this wasn't laughable enough, Susie Salmon's little sister Lindsey Salmon is walking her dog after the murder and when she stops in front of the pedophile's house the dog begins to bark at it and this is apparently all the proof the Salmon family needs to know that the he's the guy that is responsible for the murder (lol). At this point the movie becomes ridiculous when Jack Salmon tails the pedophile with a baseball bat into a corn field for some revenge only to stumble onto a pair of high school lovers which results in Jack Salmon getting his ass kicked by a jock with his own bat no less which earns him a trip to the hospital. I can go on and on but I'll end this review by saying the movie reaches it's conclusion with the murder being unsolved; the presumption that it's okay to break into a person's house to obtain evidence; Susie Salmon ridiculously manifesting herself into the body of another girl order to obtain a kiss from a five minute crush whom she met at the start of the movie; a random miniature icicle brings ultimate justice when it falls on the pedophile with the force of a soft teddy bear causing him thus to fall off a cliff (lol). Thank heaven this was only a $1 rental.  Since this movie is asinine to the tenth degree treat it like the plague and run, you'll be doing you and your family a favor. I'd imagine only a narcotics addict would find this movie remotely interesting.\n"

aS'\nHere is a book that either changed people\'s lives or irritated the bejesus out of them. Count me among the latter. \n \n Eat Pray Love - One Woman\'s Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia by Elizabeth Gilbert was supposed to enlighten me. It didn\'t.\n \n OK -- First the positive: Overall, it is a well-written book. The author takes many complicated metaphysical concepts and makes them readable. The book is divided into sections: Eat, which is the author\'s journey to Italy; Pray, her pilgrimage to India and Love, where she takes a lover in Bali. \n \n This is about a thirty-something woman looking for spirituality and happiness. She is married, but desperately unhappy for no single reason that she cannot or will not divulge. So, she leaves her husband (and, by the way, gives him all marital property out of supposed "guilt" for leaving him, making me wonder what exactly she did to warrant this)and falls right into another relationship (a-ha! adultery, perhaps?). When the rebound relationship that broke up her marriage falls apart, she now wants to find God. Of course. She claims God spoke to her on the bathroom floor, thus beginning her journey.\n \n But not before she goes to her publisher and secures a $200,000 advance for this book. Makes you wonder, as one reviewer on Amazon pointed out, was the journey retrofitted to the book proposal? \n \n What better way to go find God than in Italy. For four months she eats gelato, practices her Italian with a young man named Luca Spaghetti (If you are going to make up names of allegedly real people, could you find a more sterotypical name? Why not Carmine OrganGrinder?) and gains 23 pounds -- quick to point out to the readers that she was way underweight to beign with. \n \n She learns to enjoy life and be selfish from the Italians - who by the way still find her immensely attractive, although they don\'t hoot and holler at her like they did 10 years previously. But she is still so damned cute. Just ask her. \n \n On to India. At the Ashram, she learns to meditate and still broods over her lost marriage and subsequent realtionship. Probably the most boring part of the book, except for her conversations with "Richard from Texas" -- a down home, larger than life character who speaks in folksy platitudes that would make Andy Griffith proud. He also bestows our author with her nickname "Groceries" because she was emaciated from grief from crying for the millionth time over her beloved David. As one reviewer from Amazon said, "What kind of nickname is Groceries?" \n \n I honestly believe she made these people up. Reminds me of "Go Ask Alice" -- supposedly the real story of the drug-addicted Anonymous -- until it was revealed that the protagonist was a fictitious composite of the author\'s psychiatric patients. Boo.\n \n Then Bali. She ends her self-imposed celibacy with an older Brazilian man. High on orgasmic ecstasy, out of the supposed goodness of her heart, she asks her friends to send $18K in donations to help a single mother, an alleged friend of Ms. Gilbert\'s, who is portrayed as a con artist because she didn\'t buy a house in the timeframe coinciding with the termination of Ms. Gilbert\'s visa. I always thought that a gift should be a gift without strings attached -- especially coming from someone who supposedly found God. I wanted to ask Ms. Gilbert "What Would Jesus Do?"\n \n My biggest problem with this tome is that this 30-something woman basically is looking for applause for running off for a year, obstensibly supported by a $200K book advance, to "find God." I\'m sure millions of women would love to leave their everyday lives and travel the world to do nothing but self analyze. If she had done volunteer work, I may have felt differently. If she went through some real hardship, I could sympathize. But she was in an incompatible marriage, then dumped by the guy she left her husband for. She should perhaps speak to those battling life-threatening diseases, or raising children alone, or taking care of an elderly parent, or worried about where their next meal is coming from.\n \n And for all of her self-realization and navel-gazing to end her dependence on men, Ms Gilbert has, as pointed out by anotherAmazon reviewer, married her Brazilian and moved to new Jersey. She could have saved Penguin Books a whole lot of money by getting in her car and going through the Lincoln Tunnel. I wonder how long before she ends up back on the bathroom floor.\n \n \n'

She was a little defenseless Barbie stereotype, whose delicate southern female sensibilities were hurt when somebody so much as cursed! She cant lift a finger to defend herself, and would rather slouch off her parents with a part time job, work on her tan, then do ANYTHING. It had immense potential when it came to plot but the characters made it unenjoyable. Jericho was a horrible character who did nothing but yell, bruise, and order Mac around. None of the characters are well written and have as much substance as a toilet brush, not to mention that Mac is the most worthless excuse for a heroin in any book I have read so far.

aS'\nBy the time I finished using Bissell\'s Little Green carpet cleaning machine, I realized it would have taken less time if I\'d just taken an old toothbrush, a bottle of spot cleaner, and scrubbed the stains out.  That would have saved me the fifteen extra minutes it took to empty and clean the water tanks, the nozzle, and the cleaning head.  I could have used old towels to blot the damp carpet, which is what I ended up doing, anyway, because Little Green is little help sucking up the water left in the rug.  The spray of cleaning solution shoots in two different directions. [Very funny, Bissell.]  I\'m still wondering what the "Heater" is for, because it sure didn\'t facilitate drying and the water didn\'t stay warm for very long.  Lastly, I\'d have forgiven all of that if it had delivered an impressive cleaning; it didn\'t.  With the mixing, the messy water tanks, the scrubbing, and the additional clean-up, I have to wonder what was the point.\n'

aS"\nThe Lt. Colonel-author's book is published by the Regnery comp. that is devoted to philippics about Bill Clinton especially, and anything Democratic in general.  The author had no particularly important administrative role to the Clinton foreign or military policy development other than tagging along with the president, but he seems to consider this chore as making him as knowledgeable as Kissinger, Dulles, or Gen. Marshall in knowing what decisions should be made.   Facts were not much of a concern to this author.  Never mind that Bush I began the Somalia affair, and the reduction of military.  Or that the Republicans controlled the Congress and assisted in the reduction of the military bases under Clinton.  Also, if it was so easy to get Bin Laden, then why after sending an entire army for him has the current president still not found the guy?  And did I mention that the author was merely a tag along.  I understand that he is planning a sequel on the mismanagement of McDonalds restaurant (hey, he buys happy meals, what more does he need to know). I didn't purchase the book, so Regnery made no money off me.  But, I will consider a book by them on the revelations of the Clinton's White House gardener, or pastry chef when those books become available.

He is a (fictitious) postulant in service to Opus Dei (God\'s work), an arch-conservative semi-secret Catholic sect that is obviously up to no good --desiring, as they do, to crank the wayward church of today back a thousand years or so to when Christians really knew how to suffer. D is not the villain, by the way, and his passion for slaying is excused by the fact that when a kid, other kids teased him about his size and lack of pigmentation.\n \n Okay, now you have four highly original characters, and an opening sequence in which, it turns out, several perfectly nice and distinguished old fellows are murdered by the monk.  \n \n Where do you go now?  Well, in this enlightened age, you know how readers love books that moon religion, and especially if the moon-ee is the once venerable but now scandalized Catholic Church.  But you can\'t just make stuff up, at least not all of it, so you have to do some hard work called research, or hire someone to do it.  What you dig up does not have to be entirely true, as long as it is interesting, especially if it is a little titillating to one\'s baser instincts.\n \n History being what it is, and humans being who we are, you will discover a number of unsavory truths mixed in with a larger number of equally unsavory untruths, rumors, suspicions, legends, and valid questions.  As a creative person endowed with artistic license, you may crayola some of these tidbits to make them even more delicious, if not salacious. This is called "mining the vein of history."\n \n If you are diligent and blessed with a certain intelligence, you will, out of this stew of possibles, come up with a substory that is so gripping, so bizarre, so full of lust and corruption that few will not want to hear of it.  More work is ahead, for your true genius is revealed in how you plot the story.  When is "fact" X, hinted at or revealed, and by whom or what?  Character A knows much, but not enough; enter character B, to complement A\'s knowledge.  Even the two are still insufficient (although they are falling in love).  Alas, even the vast erudition of C leaves us wanting.  Read on!  Read on! \n \n Maybe, dear reader, after I don\'t know how many hundreds of pages, you get tired of the author\'s continuously advancing carrot and you flip to the final pages to find the final answer.  Then you might wish to turn to another novel about real people in a real world, such as A month in the Country, by J. L. Carr\n \n \n'

aS"\nUsually I am a huge fan of hats that look like food.  My meatloaf hat has been a hit for years.  When I received my turkey hat I carefully unwrapped the bubble wrap and gazed upon its tan beauty.  I, of course, melted like gravy.  For years the turkey hat design had been a mystery.  Many great food clothing designers have tried and failed, but I felt this one could have been the breakthrough we have all been waiting for.  I waited patiently as the months rolled by for that special November holiday to finally appear, and, without fail, it did.  I put on my usual Thanksgiving attire, black shoes, brown pants, white shirt and this great yellowish v neck sweater top I bought at this neat little shop in Solvang.  But my outfit was not complete.  I finally got the chance to put on my turkey hat.  It was less than fabulous.  My hopes were crushed.  The legs were a bit baggy and the tannish yellow was far from authentic.  I decided to wear it anyways in hopes we would see a Thanksgiving miracle, and as I entered my aunts house for our traditional thanksgiving dinner the room went silent.  Where years before my yam hats, buttery mash potato beret and my cranberry sauce tophat have all been cheered and talked about endlessly, my turkey hat was a flop, literally at times.  I don't know who made the initial pattern for this hat, but they should be jailed.  Something as serious as a turkey hat should not have fallen to whatever design intern was given this job.  It not only ruined my thanksgiving, it not only made my nephew throw up from crying so hard, but it made me lose my faith in food themed head wear.  SO thanks for  nothing turkey hat.\n"

aS'\nSee the rare spectacle of Sean Connery covered in mud (or chocolate pudding) while maintaining a straight face! Hear Brian Keith\'s contrived Russian accent! Experience some of the worst special effects in film history! "Meteor" (1979) gives new meaning to the term "disaster movie." Unfortunately, a better-than-necessary cast is trapped in the wreckage, including Henry Fonda as the President of the United States. Good for a few unintentional laughs.\n'

aS'\nI must say that I was initially excited about this book. Knitting with dog hair seems like one of those ideas that every pet-owning, recycling, energy-conscious responsible human being should subscribe to. However, one little thing you should be aware of before you get this book. You have to REMOVE the hair from the dog BEFORE you knit. I really wish I had been told this before I started. Sure Scout makes a great hat, but it\'s really embarrassing if you are walking down the street, wearing your admittedly very stylish chapeau, and the hat pees down the back of your neck. Believe me, after the sixth or seventh time that happened I realized there was something wrong.\n \n Fortunately Scout is getting old and struggles less and less each time I wear him and has learned to thrash his legs when he needs to be let down to "do his business" (although that causes problems, too, I\'ll have to get a book about how to knit bandages from mouse hair next). However, I\'ve been thinking about a pair of socks and I\'m pretty sure the knitting techniques will be similar, but my cats Snookums and Woogy seem to get very edgy whenever I pick up my razor.\n'

aS'\nPeople, this DVD is NOT for anyone who is already active and is less than 20 lbs. overweight. I bought this because it seemingly had three 20-minute cardio segments and I thought I\'d get a great cardio workout. NOT. In the 1st segment, the instructor is primarily running his mouth (in an attempt to motivate) and not really participating much in the actual routine. All you see is several blubbery, out of shape, out of breath flabby folks who cannot stay in unison or use proper technique to save their lives. The viewer is left with a mish-mash of poor technique and a flamboyant instructor running his mouth (and hovering around the "boys"). This may be a helpful start for those who have never worked out in their lives and who are 75 lbs OR MORE overweight but for those of us who\'ve been moderate-to extremely active and have less than 20-30 lbs. to lose, you may not find this DVD useful on any level. I am used to seeing in-shape and toned bodies on my workout DVD\'s, providing a VISUAL GOAL for myself. Right? Why would someone who is hoping to drop a few lbs want to see grossly out-of-shape folks on their TV screen? I give them props for getting off their bottoms and trying to get healthy. But I truly recommend this DVD to the extremely overweight and inactive.\n The other 2 segments at least have the instructors working out (more than the 1st instructor) but the routines are low-cardio and mundane. And of course, the group is way out of unison. \n *I was aware that the Biggest Loser cast was in the video; I just didn\'t realize they\'d be so awful and pathetic. Sorry for the unkind words.\n'

aS'\nI watched this movie twice, trying each time to do so with an open mind and see what all the hype about this movie was about. And each time I failed. The characters are battery-operated stock characters lousily acted by good (or potentially good) actors. We have the strict and egotistical father, the pragmatic and kind mother who holds the family together, the angst-ridden adolescent played by someone aged 21 (as if any teen who reads Nietzsche wants to go into the air force), the boozing-womanizer-Brooklynite grandfather (a depiction of Norman Mailer?), the depressed, pseudo-intellectual uncle (who does not act or look depressed at all during the film) and the princess daughter who enters into a beauty pageant. What happens between the beginning and the end is scarcely relevant, much less interesting: Van breaks down. Grandpa dies (none too soon). Daughter makes fun of beauty pageant contestants by doing a strip tease to the tune of Rick James\' "Superfreak." Une vraie piece de restistance. Ha, more like a piece de merde. Don\'t waste your money on this waste of talent.\n'

aS'\nThe quick version of this book: If you\'re pretty and pouty, you too can land yourself a gorgeous vampire boyfriend who will continuously save your a**.\n \n Let\'s take our main character first - Bella Swann. Yet another heroine who doesn\'t know she\'s beautiful and describes herself as shy but never exhibits the trait. The book is told in first person, which is unfortunate, because that means the reader is at ground zero for all of her insipid thoughts. She moves in with her father in his small town and holds contempt for just about everyone she meets at school, even though all they are doing is being friendly and including her. Not that any of this matters to Bella once she spots beautiful Edward. The next 500 pages are filled with purple descriptions of his magnificence, of how she\'s not worthy, of how could this god-like/Adonis-like creature stoop to love her.\n \n I\'m going to try to condense my irritation with Bella into a series of points:\n     * She\'s ridiculously clumsy, which is meant to be a fault, is passed off as charming, but basically just gives her an asinine reason not to run so Edward can save her.\n     * She "falls in love" with Edward within weeks of knowing him, and after a couple hundred pages, if he even mentions leaving, she hyperventilates and acts like her world will freaking collapse. Stalking is illegal in all 50 states, Bella.\n     * Whenever Eddikens so much as barely brushes his lips with hers, she either tries to rip his clothes off (natural) or her heart stops beating and she passes out. The girl hit the floor so many times in this book she put Giles to shame.\n \n Which brings me to Edward. Angsty telepathic vampire Edward. While we have very little clear idea what Bella looks like, we get to hear about Eddiken\'s gorgeous, transcendental face and body over and over and over again. He\'s impossibly frustrating because he\'s been crammed with so many character traits, depending entirely on what the author wants him to be like at the time. He calls himself a monster and thinks he should have died all those years ago, but then totally lords his awesomeness over the mundane humans. And he is awesome. Lest you forget it, he\'s even awesomer than the rest of his vampire family at everything. \n \n But the worst part about Edward is how he treats Bella. He is initially attracted to her because her smell is particularly attractive to him (okay, I\'ll bite) and because he can\'t read her thoughts. (Trust me, Eddikens, I\'m lookin\' right at \'em, and there ain\'t nothin\' up there worth wondering about.) He knows he\'s a danger to her (woe!) and tells her straight off that it\'s better if they not be around each other (sorrow!)...and then he proceeds to hang all over her! He berates himself once every few pages for putting her in danger but never has the guts to fix the matter because he "just can\'t stay away from her" and "[she\'s his] life now." *wretch*\n \n The author\'s writing style is unimpressive. Not bad, per se, but it wasn\'t giving me anything new. It all felt rather generic. Her vampires weren\'t bad - the "ultimate predators" and all that - but they were slightly ruined by her reasoning of why vamps can\'t go out in the sun. It\'s not because they\'ll burn up and die - it\'s because they glitter. That\'s right - these are GlamRock!Vampires. I also can see how Bella never takes Edward seriously when he tells her he\'s dangerous and she shouldn\'t want to be cursed with vampirism. Honestly, the author never shows us anything negative about the condition. It\'s all quick reflexes, superiority and baseball games with the fam.\n \n The plot is bogus. Four hundred pages of ill-conceived romance and then a quick 100 pages of worse-conceived conflict. The romance, to put it frankly, is a little disturbing in how it borders on the obsessive, especially on Bella\'s side because he\'s just so, so, so beautiful!\n \n And that\'s what bothers me the most about this book and the message that it sends to all of its rabid readers: the importance of beauty. Not inner beauty, either. Edward and his wonderful vampire family (all of whom are good because they don\'t feed on humans) are described over and over again in all of their wonderful physical qualities. They\'re cardboard characters for us to admire. Bella, of course, doesn\'t think of herself as beautiful, but the fact that she has four other boys in addition to the vampire falling all over themselves to please her begs to differ. I was willing to forgive the beauty of the vampires as a trait they acquire when they\'re turned, but a few others turn up later that are described as "nondescript" and ordinary-looking. And of course, they turn out to be the bad guys. Really, Stephanie Meyer?\n \n I\'m not buying it.  Or your sequels for that matter.\n'

aS"\nThis is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read.  To begin with, the story is blase, the world is never described, even the main character and her &quot;powers&quot; are not properly explored.  The writing sounds  like a cross between a smarty pants teenager with the fantasy of a nine  year old wrapped into a very uncreative roleplayer who wanted to make a  one-dimensional character fly into our hearts. WRONG.  Even the writer  losses her own consistency.  Halfway through the story, I'm reading of the  events taking place through a Saturday, and what happened to the characters  earlier that morning was described as happening the day before.  Am I the  only person with it?  How could the author and the editors have missed such  a thing?  All the characters actions were misplaced and the reasons,  unmotivated.  If you want to bore yourself, and spend the 7 bucks it takes  to read to the witless dialogue and waste the rest of your time trying to  grasp the very underdevloped world of Hamilton's, please go to the library,  or else you'll hate yourself.  I instead suggest sitting infront of the TV  on Tuesdays and watching some Buffy.  It's a much better portrayal of the  supernatural, with smart, intelligent characters and writing to boot.\n"

The tuners are decent (for a very inexpensive guitar) but once tuned all cords sounded off key. Not playable if you can hear. However if deaf it might be quite fun. The plastic fingerboard, painted binding, and plastic bridge are disapointing, but when this guitar makes it to my chop shop, the bridge pins and tuners might be usefull on another gutar. If you buy it for a child, you won't have to wory about teaching them how to tune. It will make little difference.\n"

aS"\nIts funny to look back on the cartoons you loved as a kid and wonder why they captivated you so much. Watching it now, I'm really not sure why. Now its just hilarious. The dialogue is terrible and the amount of overtly homoeroticsm in these cartoons boils way over the top. There's one part where robotic villian, Lockjaw, struggles to find a suitable weapon for his detachable arm, and in doing so makes grunting noises and rapidly moves his arm up and down, which looks alot like a struggle of a much different kind. Just one example. I mean, c'mon! Look at Prince Adam's or He-Man's attire! Pink shirt and Purple leotards! Furry short shorts with boots! Shoulder length blond hair! Then you go through the special features and hear the creator talk, you can definitely see that the guy is gay. I mean, no problem with that, it just adds to the comedy of it all. If you have a sense of humor about these kind of things, than this cartoon is for you.\n"

aS"\nSince taking delivery of my pen I have been very happy with the quality of ink deposition on the various types of paper that I have used. On the first day when I excitedly unwrapped my pen (thanks for the high quality packaging Amazon!) I just couldn't contain my excitement and went around finding things to write on, like the shopping list on the notice board in our kitchen, the Post-it notes next to the phone, and on my favorite lined A4 pad at the side of my desk.\n \n My pen is the transparent type with a blue lid. I selected this one in preference to the orange type because I like to be able to see how much ink I have left so that I can put in another order before I finally run out.\n \n When the initial excitement of taking delivery of my new pen started to wear off I realized that I shouldn't just write for the fun of it, this should be a serious enterprise, so by the second day of ownership I started to take a little more care of what I wrote. I used it to sign three letters, and in each case was perfectly happy with the neatness of handwriting that I was able to achieve.\n \n I have a helpful tip for you that you might not know about - if you let the ink dry for a few seconds you can avoid the smudging that sometimes happens if you rub the ink immediately after writing. Fortunately the ink used in this particular Bic pen seems to dry very quickly.\n \n On the third day of ownership I went on a trip to London and took my pen carefully packed away in my brief case, but I needn't have worried, this isn't some temperamental ink pen that leaks when you store it at the wrong angle. I sat at my meeting and confidently removed the cap from my pen and it wrote flawlessly, almost immediately.\n \n I notice that the barrel of the pen has been crafted very carefully to fit in the pen holder down the edge of my Filofax. It's not so grippy so that it is hard to remove when I want to make a quick note, and yet not so loose that it falls out too easily when I open my Filofax in a hurry. Maybe the choice of surface texture on the pen has some part to play here, because it seems that the inside of the leather grip on the pen holder in my Filofax has just the right level of adhesion that I can be confident when I need to reach in and get my pen it's going to be just where I left it!\n \n Today is the fourth day of ownership of my pen, and I have to say I'm starting to treat it like an old friend. I walk around the office with it clipped in to my shirt pocket and someone in the accounts department actually asked to borrow it while we were both standing at the photocopier. Would you believe it, they actually tried to walk away with my pen! They were very embarrassed when I called after them as they walked down the corridor and asked for it back. You will be happy to know that it is now back, safe and sound in my top pocket, ready and waiting to start writing again.\n \n In summary, I would happily recommend this pen to anyone who is planning on writing on paper. If you are considering a writing implement for some other surface such as writing on a CD, or other non-porous substances then another pen might be better suited, but if it's just plain old paper then I think you will probably be well served by this particular model.\n [tx to M Williams/amazon.co.uk]\n"

aS"\nI was heartbroken when it was cancelled and became a huge fan of directv when they picked it up for season 3...BUT I just read on [...] (which is linked to Amazon) that they are releasing only the shortened/edited NBC season 3 - not the full episodes aired on directv's Channel 101.  AND changing the music for the dvds.\n \n Basically, the fans and directv saved this show - and NBC is going to shaft the fans-AGAIN- by releasing shortened episodes instead of full directv episodes.  I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOO MAD.  How much more could it really cost to release the entire episodes?  And something has to be done to negotiate use of the music up front because fans of all shows usually love the music that was originally chosen by the original creative forces behind the show - rather than after the fact, haphazard changing the music to save money.  If you are willing to spend $30 on season 3 (or buy it on sale) - you would probably spend $40 just as easily to get the full episodes with the real music.\n \n What a racket!  I usually hate 1 star reviews that have nothing to do with the show - but the way it was released(like a volume 1 etc. just to make money) but when the way it is being released means you have no access to the full episodes on dvd-I think it deserves 1 star because it is content related.  At least with a volume 1, they may be squeezing you for money but you know you have the option to buy volume 2 and get the entire season.  This way, you just get edited episodes - with no hope of full episodes.\n \n By the way, it also said there would be a season 4&5 - YAHOO!!\n"

aS"\nYes, the STORY itself is great. The Tuohys should be commended and I am glad they made the film to bring awareness to that. I do like Sandra in it, but was it an Oscar-worthy performance? No. (as a comparison Julia Roberts' performance as Erin Brockovich was far superior) And to put that little kid front and center like that through the whole thing with his over-acting was a total distraction, unrealistic, and annoying. He was the Jar-Jar Binks of the movie for sure. And riiiiiiiiight...this little kid coached Mike making him the great football player that he is because a first grader knows more about football than any real coach does. Sure. Whatever. And TIM MCGRAW in a lead role? Who came up with that idea? Something tells me he didn't show up at the casting call and beat out everyone else out because he's a better actor than all the real actors out there. He's a country western SINGER with NO acting experience (or ability) as I found out from watching this movie. I also find it HARD to believe that she would just be able to yell at some bigoted redneck in the stands and drug dealers and have NO consequences for that at all. Yeah, I'm gonna drive my 7-Series BMW to the drug-dealer hang out, get out dressed in diamonds and expensive clothes and threaten drug dealers who kill people on a regular basis all by myself, get in all of their faces and tell them I have a gun in my $800 Gucci bag and just shut them all down verbally because I'm just ALL THAT?

aS'\nLike any profession the burglary profession has bit hit hard by the recession. People just don\'t buy luxury goods anymore and when they do they tend to protect these assets with more care, i.e. dogs, guns, security alarms. First and foremost, notice the matte finish-- for burglars beyond the amateur level matte finish is essential. I know there are some flashy cat burglars that take a lot of joy in a gloss coat but for us ninja-type burglars we want to get in and get out as quickly and painlessly as possible. That means, low profile matte finish burgling tools like this. \n \n Second, alarms. I have em\' in my house-- what a pain huh? Your kid or dog sets em\' off. You\'re trying to do your job robbing a house and you get a call from Brinks to say that it appears you have a break in, then your kid calls, can\'t remember the code to switch it off, and you\'re arguing with the Brinks guy in the middle of your job while you\'re trying to kill the alarm from the outside. The crow bar hinge on the end of this blade is great for breaking to security boxes and cutting the power. After that the only real tough part is bonking the dog on the head with its solid handle and making a mad dash for the goods. I\'ve only had one time where I\'ve really had to use the blade-- look-- the guy had a gun! All I did was swing the blade nice and quick, off goes the hand and I was out of the house with the goods. EASY. 10 stars for this self-defense/burglar blade. Really do yourself a favor and pick-up one before you go "shopping" for some of your neighbors goods.\n'

aS'\nI went into Watchmen with high expectations because I know that it\'s suppose to be like the best graphic novel ever. but I was not only horribly disappointed, but utterly disgusted. \n Watchmen is a film filled with over the top preachy narration and lines with little storyline advancement because of all the flashbacks and tries to make you understand the alternate history, that the first 3/4 of the film you have absolute no idea what it\'s trying to get at (unless, of course you are familiar with the graphic novel it\'s based upon). Then at the end you realize that it\'s the same old same old (though only universaly WESTERN idealism):\n \n * human beings are inheritantely corrupt (thanks alot)\n * peace can only be achieved through catastrophe, in other words, without apocalyse or apocalyptical events, there can only be war (which I only agree to the degree that if you kept trying to convince people this, the religious fundies ought to be VERY HAPPY when they see this film)\n * There has to be a god-like scapegoat for it to be happen, and it\'s gonna be American (sorry Jesus Christ), and he will not actually be responsible for the apocalypse, only scapegoating it (ergo: if some God-like creature destroyed the entire human race, it\'s probably not his fault but corrupt human beings\')\n \n last but not least that made me most angry:\n *women: if you got pregnant from rape, you should ALWAYS have the kid, because the kid will always turn out to be the best thing that ever happen to you. \n \n I have to admit that Watchmen hides its clichedness well, it wasn\'t until the very end did I actually realize all this. But there was a point in which I thought it might head into a though-provoking direction, that it might actually get at a point that makes you go "hmm... interesting," and that\'s when Dr. Manhattan raise the conscience: what is so special about the lives of human beings, or lives in general, most part of galaxy (or universe if you\'ll make that assumption that earth is unique with life) get along just fine without life. \n \n Interestingly good point, cool, that made me think for a moment\n \n then it got destroyed by the bottom-of-the barrel foolish "epiphany" of Dr. Manhattan that he should save human race because of Silk Spectral number two, because she is something good that came out of chaos. Therefore life must be special if "good life" can come out of chaos.\n \n If you just sit there and think this though for a moment you\'ll see that this logic makes absolutely NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. Why? because if you already take the assumption that all lives (and non-lives) are equal, as Dr. M suggests because he\'s so high and mighty and all that, then how would "rape" be catagorized as "chaos?" Rape and rape-like things happen often in the animal and, some would argue, plant and bacterial kingdom. It\'s only the fact that rape brings suffering to human beings, and we, the human beings, must PERCEIVE it as chaos because it brings suffering to us (mostly the women), will makes it "chaos." So you must assume that: \n 1. there\'s something special and non-chaotic (good) about human lives\n 2. Rape brings suffering/chaos\n therefore conclusion:\n 3. rape is chaotic.\n \n So this sudden "epiphany" of Dr. M basically just came out of nowhere, maybe it\'s because he does believe that human lives are special but just doesn\'t wanna show it since he\'s god and all that and it\'s just too humiliating and difficult to suffer in love in his condition. Not to mention after all the talk of anti-life, he\'s actually pro-life (not even pro-choice)!!\n \n A friend suggested to me that (he has read the graphic novel) the point is the irony: corrupted human beings (the watchmen) are the ones to rise above to save the human race. \n interesting but whether or not the graphic novel perserves this idea, the movie certainly does not. Why? because the watchmen (in the movie) who actually fought the crimes either did it to appease their own vanity (to be like pharohs, to bring divine justice) or did it for thrills (which is like most of them). Hey apocalypse is coming, what better way to spend your Last Days then to have sex and kick some butt? Dude I would totally go for it. \n \n Overall this film is painful to watch, especially for humanists/feminists like me. The only thing I learned from this film is that kept getting people paranoid about world-ending does it\'s self-fufilling prophecy thing. Sadly I already knew that since I have a B.A. in Psychology.\n'

I had 2 playlists, each with about 500MB of music.  The music would play fine, but switching playlists would take about 2 minutes.  That\'s right, with a flash player (ie. no moving parts), it would take a full 2 minutes for it to start playing a song when I changed playlists.

All I know is that it was totally annoying and completely ridiculous.\n \n When I got sick of it and looked on Sansa\'s website, I noticed they had a firmware upgrade.  So, hoping it was a bug that had been fixed, I ran their firmware updater.  IT CRASHED!!  My jaw nearly hit the floor when the updater crashed.  For those that don\'t know, an aborted firmware update is the equivalent of a lobotomy for an electronic device.  For what it\'s worth, the player worked for another day, but then just quit after that.\n \n I plugged it into the computer to sync some music, and it was not recognized.  So, I unhooked it and replaced the battery, hoping to clear whatever snafu was happening.  Since that (1/2 hour ago), I\'ve been staring at the Sansa bootup screen, hoping against all hope that it will eventually spring to life.\n \n I wanted a good quality, non-iPod mp3 player.  Simple, easy, and inexpensive.  The m250 is none of these, considering that you\'ll end up throwing it in the trash and buying something else.  Save yourself the trouble and get something worthwhile.\n'

aS'\nI understand setting. And build up. And suspense. So after reading 100  pages of this book, I didn\'t give it too much thought that nothing had happened. Here is my report of what happened after that:\n \n 200 pages: Nothing has happened.\n \n 300 pages: Nothing has happened. \n \n 350 pages: Nothing has happened.\n \n 400 pages: NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.\n \n Are you Kidding me?\n \n Wait. WAIT. On page 441, something happens. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. O my God, this is it. Something is really going to happen! I plodded through this padded wasteland and finally something is going to happen!\n \n Oh. Wait. It\'s resolved by page 451. \n \n I\'m not making this up.\n \n So let me sum it up for you. \n \n Bella falls for Edward because he is attractive (we are told he looks like an "angel" "is angelic" "is seraphic" and oh, again, "looks like an angel," on about pages 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 17, 20, 33, 34, 35, 40, 44 . . . you get the idea. I understand that "angel" might not be in a thesaurus, but FOR GODDSAKES, find a new description. Also, his hair is described, alternately, as auburn and bronze. Did anyone else have a problem with the fact that these are completely different colors? Seriously.\n \n So Bella loves Edward for his looks. How precious.\n \n Edward loves Bella for her smell. \n \n What a beautiful, timeless romance. \n \n Spare me. \n \n Also, was anyone painfully unimpressed with the whole Alice side-story? Meyer obviously planted the hints about Alice\'s missing memory, only to explain it away later to *shock and surprise* us, with something completely uninteresting. It\'s like the saying goes: if you see a gun in chapter one, it\'s going to go off in chapter three. But if the gun goes off in chapter three during target practice and only manages to hit a tree branch, did it even NEED to be in chapter one in the first place? The Alice thing was pointless. Call me when you have a real twist.\n \n I imagine this book is lovely for ambitious twelve year olds who want to tackle a five hundred page novel. They will find it easy to do so, because Twilight reads like a painfully long letter an immature but stuck-up pre-adolescent writes to her pen pal. \n \n I am SO SAD this passes for good teenage fiction.\n \n And this is why, when someone announces she writes Young Adult fiction, that people say, "Why don\'t you want to write real books?"\n \n And that\n Sucks.\n'

aS'\nWhen Big Bobby Ray told me there was a foxy lady\'s version of that legendary 3 Wolves shirt I just had to get one for myself. Look out Bobby Raye there\'s a new Loca Lobo in town. My hands trembled when I opened the package and I couldn\'t get over that lovely Trailer Lavendar color and the almost air-brushed quality of the wolves. I cranked up the Kid Rock, put on my best cut-offs (you know the kind, that ride up just enough in the front and back) gave the bleach blond hair a fresh squirt of Aquanet (roots be darned) and told that Bobby Ray we were loading up in the Trans Am and to let that coon tail fly. These lady wolves really unleash my womanly power, no woman at Wal-mart, the tanning salon, the county fair, the beer joint, or the Nascar race will look hotter. Ok, Verna Sue, we\'ll see who gets promoted at the feed store now! Especially when I tie the shirt just so and let a little of the jelly hang out- must be jelly cause jam don\'t shake like that. Just look at those wolves...no one can resist the "come here big boy" look of that she-wolf. Can\'t wait for this Friday night when Bobby and I wear our matching wolf redneck couture line and go down to the Bingo hall and then when we get home...if the trailer\'s rockin\' don\'t bother knockin. All thanks to this graceful wolf finery- get yours cause I got mine.\n'

aS'\nI had high hopes for this book, if for nothing else, then as a chuckle-inducing bathroom read. \n \n I must say, I was gravely disappointed. The book literally did not elicit a single laugh from me, and most of the "suggestions" would only lead to you quickly becoming the supreme village idiot. The only reason I read the entire book was because I just had to know HOW bad this book could get. Quite bad, indeed, it reminds of a train wreck: so bad you just can\'t look away. \n \n Now, I consider my self to have quite the sense of humor, yet this book just did not deliver on any level. If you consider yourself levelheaded, I\'m sure you will agree. \n \n If you want to read some real good chaff, go ahead and get this book. My copy is in the trash. I\'m ashamed to have owned it.\n'

aS'\nIf you\'re sick of fake metal bands with no talent (Megadeth, 80s Metallica, Opeth, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Borknagar, Queensryche, etc - basically any of the crap that only posers praise) then you need to get this. They show so-called "metal" bands how to play REAL metal, and also that solos suck. This is MUCH better than anything those losers in the 80s could do. Once again unknown posers with guitars such as Malmsteen, Satriani, McLaughlin, Michael Romeo and Allan Holdsworth are shown how to actually play. This band is like sooooooo deep. Like Chester Bennington, I am a tortured artist; one too complex and intelligent to be understood by people who don\'t watch MTV or TRL. That\'s why I like MTV, because it caters to head-strong anti-mainstream rebels such as myself. So, if you are sick of fake "metal" from posers with long hair who don\'t know how to hold their instruments, then get this. If you want something just as deep that still rocks then get Good Charlotte.\n'

With our laptops firmly in place we were able to focus our attention on what really mattered, participating in raids with our WoW clan. During our last flight we were so immersed in trying to take down Eranikus that we overshot Minneapolis by a full hour and a half before some annoying flight attendant interrupted us, babbling something about "FAA and F16 fighters."\n \n We\'ll definitely use this product again at our next gig, whatever and whenever that happens to be...\n \n Highly recommended! \n \n'

aS"\nThis product has a serious design flaw.  When I removed this product from its container, it did not stand on its own as I expected.  Instead, it spread out onto the ground, then appeared to disappear into it.  For the price I paid, I would have expected this product to have a lot more substance.  Someone told me that I needed a glass, but this is not listed in the instructions.  Also, there are no clear instructions on how to open the container.  I tried everything from cotton balls to a can opener, to no avail.  Eventually I was able to open it by burning a hole in it with a curling iron.  I was afraid to use a knife, since I didn't want to damage the product inside.  Clearly, Tuscan needs to re-think this product.\n \n **Edit**  It seems that I would have had to let this sit at room temperature for several days in order for it to stand on its own.

aS"\nI am almost embarrassed to admit the lack of reviews regarding this particular piece of lost lore.  This protective article of clothing is much more than meets the eye.  Simple pixles from your computer screen couldn't possibly capture the majestic and unbridled power of this cloak.  There are *actual yeti hairs inscribed into each fiber of cotton.  Upon first donning this garment, all former vestiges of humanity are lost.  I was immediately transformed into a towering ogrillion figure, 12 feet at least, and began my rampage.  I hold no memories from this torrential act, however, the next day's paper gave insight to the destruction I, no doubt, wreaked.  The obituary section actually took up the entire contents of the paper, the Statesmen labeling this the worst case of killing-spree homicide the world has seen yet.  This is a definite must buy, considering the raw power of this more-than-celestial article.  Purchase this shirt today, and release the debiltating, dragging bonds of society.  Let go of your humanity and embrace the yeti.\n"

aS'\nCASIO watches are the best thing that has ever invented. I bought this watch a little less than a month ago and was shocked and awed by the amount of attention I received over it. Before I bought the CASIO CA53W-1 Watch with Calculator I was a nothing, I was no one, no one on my campus recognized me. All of the people I knew were stupid gaming retards, all they cared about was Modern Warfare 2 coming out soon. They were like "Sean come play Modern Warfare with us, it totally is the best game ever. Play Modern Warfare to tune your skills for Modern Warfare 2." and I told them to get some lotion and go into the bathroom because I wasn\'t playing any more video games, I was becoming a man. The first thing I did was to sell my xbox 360 and all its accessories on craigslist for $150 (I had a lot of stuff), the reason being was that I had an epiphany when they told me to play Modern Warfare with them. The epiphany is: there will always be new video games coming out, most of them aren\'t worth your time. Anyways so I sold my xbox, and then I got a haircut. Well I got many hairs cut and ended up getting a fashionable haircut like that of Edward Cullen on Twilight. I figure all the girls love him right? They all want to take him into the bathroom without lotion or Maxim, if I look like him, I will get all the babes. I also got a Bowflex PR3000 Home Gym, now I work out 3 times a week and I am totally ripped (well at least I\'m ripping). I then purchased this CASIO CA53W-1 Watch with Calculator, the first girl that talked to me about it was Janet, from my circuit analysis class. She told me that she liked my watch, that maybe we should hang out sometime. Janet had always been my dream girl, smart, funny, engineering major, mildly overweight (but in a good way), and she loved CASIO watches. I mean who doesn\'t right? Well I decided that the first girl that talked to me about my watch was going to be the one. I left circuit analysis class walking next to Janet, my ex-friend Jake from Modern Warfare came up to me and asked if I wanted to play in 20 minutes. I asked him what 7251 times 8 was, he couldn\'t tell me. I flashed him my CASIO CA53W-1 Watch with Calculator and told him to go into the bathroom with some lotion and a copy of Maxim, he knew immediately that he would never talk to me again. I cannot more highly recommend this watch to anyone, it is comfortable, has a watch, calculator, alarm clock, and most importantly for Janet and I it has a stopwatch.\n'

aS'\nI am (as you will read) completely ignorant about car stereo stuff.  I wanted to put this story in here just in case it helps someone else to get their unit working!\n \n I got this for my birthday (off my wish list).  It does pretty much what it says it will do. :)  I wanted HD Radio (I live in Houston) and a way to play ANY OTHER DEVICE through an aux port on the front.  The USB hookup was gravy.\n \n \n \n So, I had it installed a couple of days ago.  Worked great, but when my RPM\'s increased from my engine, a DEFINITE WHINE also came out of the speakers.\n \n I took it back to the shop that installed it.  They came out and hemmed and hawed and said some things about DUAL being a crappy radio and there was nothing they could do.\n \n ... well, they could try a COUPLE of things, maybe. :)\n \n So first they tried these $24 noise filter thingies ($24 for 2).  Those didn\'t work.\n \n So the main installer guy just kept looking sad for me and I kept looking hopeful.\n \n He tried grounding the radio to the chassis.  That didn\'t work.\n \n (more sad looking guy, more determinedly hopeful me)\n \n Then he said, "Well, I can try one more thing, but I\'m sure this won\'t work.  It\'s a &lt;stereoguyterm>... DUAL\'s too cheap to put them on their radios and I have to cut them off of other radios occasionally... so I\'ve got some of them in the back."\n \n He installed whatever it was on the power supply side (?) and it worked FANTASTIC(ly).\n \n It looked like a little black box and I think was a filter of some sort on the power side.\n \n They didn\'t charge me anything for the adventure, but obviously should have.\n \n I drive a Toyota Sienna minivan with JBL stuff on my speakers.  Apparently that was important.  \n \n Now it works great.  Reception in Houston has been great.  It plays through the line-in Aux port great (I use it with my ipod and creative zen) and USB keys work.  I\'m not sure it ever shows the file names it\'s playing off the USB, which is weird but not worth $100 to upgrade to a better stereo.\n \n So, it works but had quite a bit of fiddling to make it go.\n \n It\'s great for the $.  I have fairly low standards... I only listen to audiobooks, podcasts, NPR, etc.  So I have no idea what the audiophiles would think.  \n \n \n (and, for the snarky, YES, there was a sale on the word "great" today.)\n'

aS"\nI was expecting this to be way better than Twilight because I heard there was way more action. Guess what I bailed out an hour and 30 minutes in. ITs way more dull and boring than Twilight. Theres still no plot, Bella is a b****, and theres still no true conflict. She ends up getting everything she wants at the end of the series anyway including a perfect family with no troubles at 18. OMG shocking isn't it!\n \n  I'm serious Bella p***es me off. I have never watched a movie with a main character so detestable. She basically goes into a canatonic state when Edward leaves her and the segment showing how deep her depression is was just ridiculus. She just sits in a chair with the same d*** clothes on for months because a vampire boy she knew for only a week or so leaves town. All of a sudden she loses the will to live and purposely puts herself in danger just to see hallucinations of him. I was actually hoping she would die just so this story would end. But saddly that doesn't happen.\n \n  Then theres Jacob. I actually think Bella would have been better off with Jacob because he seems to have more personallity than Edward who don't know WTF he wants. Plus I think Jacob is better looking too. Hes brown, buff, got long hair, and Edward just sparkle. I don't know what girls see in Edward. Hes just too pale and isn't that good looking. i've seen better looking guys on the big screen. Plus her relationship with Jacob seemed more normal even as friends while her relationship with Edward has no chemistry whatsoever. Other than this I didn't care about any of the characters and was completely bored. \n \n  The so called action scenes in this movie...STILL BORING! I wasn't impressed at all with it. The werewolves also looked ridiculus. The CG was terrible. I know peaple argue that thier shapeshifters and not wolves, but why are they usually referred to as werewolves! The werewolves are also kind of strange. From what I've seen most of them are males and they walk around most of the time with thier shirts off in the woods. ~sings~ FAAAANNNNNSEEEERRVVVICCES! For the ladies. LOL. As an 18 year old woman I won't complain too much about that, but its still strange. I also noticed that they make Jacobs transition into a werewolf sound like hes coming out the closet or something. That shows how bad the dialogue is.\n  \n  Did this really need to be 2 hours! I have to give this movie credit though. I like that they got rid of most of that blue look and the cinemagraphy was way better. There were also moment that made me laugh so hard because of how insane they were. One being an example is there is one scene where there at a birthday party and somehow Bella being the clumsy b**** she is cuts herself with wrapping paper (I don't know how thats possible) and one of the vampires go crazy and tries to attack her. Sounds interesting right? Well Edward being the loving boyfriend he is protects her by pushing her into a glass table adding more injury. LMAO! He couldn't just push the attacking vamp away?! He could've just restrain him! But noo! He just pushes her into a case making the situation worse. LOL\n \n  The problem I have is that this is just a bad story that seems to go nowhere.  The romance mostly stems from the nition that Edward and Bella are a perfect couple, but its just boring. Theres no true climax either. What angers me the most is that so much more could have been done to make this series so much better. The story contradicts itself so much too. I'm baffled as to how anyone can love this series so much. Oh well its target audience is house wives and 14 year old girls. Maybe they see something in it I will never understand.   \n \n"

aS"\nSince taking delivery of my pen I have been very happy with the quality of ink deposition on the various types of paper that I have used.  On the first day when I excitedly unwrapped my pen (thanks for the high quality packaging Amazon!) I just couldn't contain my excitement and went around finding things to write on, like the shopping list on the notice board in our kitchen, the Post-it notes next to the phone, and on my favourite lined A4 pad at the side of my desk.\n \n My pen is the transparent type with a blue lid.  I selected this one in preference to the orange type because I like to be able to see how much ink I have left so that I can put in another order before I finally run out.\n \n When the initial excitement of taking delivery of my new pen started to wear off I realised that I shouldn't just write for the fun of it, this should be a serious enterprise, so by the second day of ownership I started to take a little more care of what I wrote.  I used it to sign three letters, and in each case was perfectly happy with the neatness of handwriting that I was able to achieve.\n \n I have a helpful tip for you that you might not know about - if you let the ink dry for a few seconds you can avoid the smudging that sometimes happens if you rub the ink immediately after writing.  Fortunately the ink used in this particular Bic pen seems to dry very quickly.\n \n On the third day of ownership I went on a trip to London and took my pen carefully packed away in my brief case, but I needn't have worried, this isn't some temperamental ink pen that leaks when you store it at the wrong angle. I sat at my meeting and confidently removed the cap from my pen and it wrote flawlessly, almost immediately.\n \n I notice that the barrel of the pen has been crafted very carefully to fit in the pen holder down the edge of my Filofax.  It's not so grippy so that it is hard to remove when I want to make a quick note, and yet not so loose that it falls out too easily when I open my Filofax in a hurry.  Maybe the choice of surface texture on the pen has some part to play here, because it seems that the inside of the leather grip on the pen holder in my Filofax has just the right level of adhesion that I can be confident when I need to reach in and get my pen it's going to be just where I left it!\n \n Today is the fourth day of ownership of my pen, and I have to say I'm starting to treat it like an old friend.  I walk around the office with it clipped in to my shirt pocket and someone in the accounts department actually asked to borrow it while we were both standing at the photocopier.  Would you believe it, they actually tried to walk away with my pen!  They were very embarrassed when I called after them as they walked down the corridor and asked for it back.  You will be happy to know that it is now back, safe and sound in my top pocket, ready and waiting to start writing again.\n \n In summary, I would happily recommend this pen to anyone who is planning on writing on paper.  If you are considering a writing implement for some other surface such as writing on a CD, or other non-porous substances then another pen might be better suited, but if it's just plain old paper then I think you will probably be well served by this particular model.\n"

aS'\nIt\'s my own private theory that the decade between roughly 1966, and roughly 1976, represents not just a sea-change/high-point/Belle Epoque of the arts in this country, but the duration of a force-field imposed by aliens who briefly took over our bodies and spent a long arts and crafts holiday here, giving us 2001 and REVOLVER and BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS and CLOSE TO THE EDGE and CHINATOWN and much more in the process; and when they left at last for their home world, the bodies they inhabited reverted right back to their true selves. In the case of Mel Brooks, through whose corporeal shell the Visitors had crafted THE PRODUCERS, BLAZING SADDLES and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, that means a pushy, tiresome, obnoxious hack.\n \n Well, it\'s as good an explanation as any, right? Brooks so totally lost the plot from the latter half of the 70s on that bodysnatching aliens and Faustian bargains spring naturally to mind as reasonable explanations: that\'s how fast, and far, he fell off the cliff. There isn\'t a single funny moment in his ROBIN HOOD spoof, but this is far worse than simply "unfunny". Few things in life are as painful to endure as third-rate comedy performed badly, by incompetents incapable of timing a gag or delivering even a throwaway line without stepping on the joke. Not that this is measurably worse than the half-dozen or so lead balloons Brooks made prior to this. On the other hand, it\'s every bit as wheezingly unfunny as they were. If it wasn\'t, would Dick van Patten even be in this? Yeah.... when I think of freewheeling, anything-goes absurdist satire, Van Patten\'s the first name that comes to mind. \n \n Oh, yeah....about those jokes. They\'re about on the level of a Bob Hope Special from 1971, only with the racier, edgier material cut out.\n \n "And this is my friend Will Scarlet." \n \n "Well, Scarlet\'s my middle name. (pause) My full name is Will Scarlet O\'Hara. (longer pause) We\'re from Georgia."\n \n That\'s one of the better ones, folks. And even though the joke as written is terrible, and could never be made funny no matter how it was read, the tortuous Pasadena Playhouse pauses actually make the thing even worse than it already is. Which is pretty much this movie in a nutshell - bad ideas, made worse by terrible writing, further doomed by an unsuitable cast, all of whom flail away helplessly without any sort of competent direction. \n \n If you must see this, see it on basic cable so you\'ll at least have the cell-phone and diet soda commercials to look forward to. And maybe you, too, will wonder how it was possible anybody ever thought Mel Brooks was a genius, and how in the world did he keep getting money to make these godawful comedies? I can\'t help you with the second question, but as far as the first goes, trust me; it was the aliens. \n \n'

aS'\nI happened upon my Zubaz at the mall in (19)95, and automatically I was overcome by a spiritual, animal connection. My soul ached and cried: I am just a man, trapped in my faded denim jeans. My animal spirit was calling me, and I knew at that moment that, for to truly be at one with nature, I must wear purple zebra print pants.\n \n When I got some, I ran into the woods with only my Zubaz and armed with a pocket knife. In solitude I sat in the woods, living and thinking like the animal, when I happened upon a wolf. There I was, both of us staring into each others eyes. We knew. We felt. We WERE.\n \n During my meditations, I started to itch. Was it poison oak? Ants? It was Cat Scratch Fever. It was the telepathic oneness with Ted Nugent. I imagined Nugent. I saw him running with the Buffalo, in Neon green Zubaz, free. He pulled out a knife, much like my own, and slit the wild beast throat. He then looked in my minds eye, and nodded to me, and disappeared  in pure white light.\n \n Thank you Zubaz, for the spiritual awakening.\n'

aS'\nThe sick thing is, no matter how repetitious and predictable this game is, I can\'t stop playing.\n \n If you\'re reading this and don\'t know what "Puzzle Quest" is, I\'m honestly surprised.  Go read my review of the first game and know that this one is...  Well, kind of different.\n \n Too lazy?  Okay.  "Puzzle Quest" is "Bejeweled" crossed with "Dungeons & Dragons."  But not D&D 4e; no d20 systems here or anything.  This is all about matching three things and winning.\n \n Except, you can win.  This is an epic advancement over the first game.  The original "Puzzle Quest" would string four- and five-length matches together repeatedly until you were dead.  Sometimes you didn\'t even get to play a round before you lost.  You would click on an opponent, challenge them, and immediately face a screen explaining that you\'ve lost.\n \n "Puzzle Quest 2" fixes this.  I\'m certain the game is still cheating, but to make up for it, the game also has artificial idiocy programmed.  Every so often, it skips an opportunity to run your face into an orc\'s backside, allowing you the chance to run the computer\'s face into an orc\'s backside.\n \n The problem is, who cares?  It\'s still just "Bejeweled" and weren\'t we supposed to be tired of that in 2005?  I guess not, because I\'m still matching fist gems together to earn enough action points to throw a knife into a goblin\'s eyeball.\n \n The other major change is everything else.  Instead of clicking on a map and moving to a point on a giant board game overview, now you stomp around in an isometric view like that old NES wizarding game, "Snake Rattle & Roll."  While "Snake Rattle & Roll" had you bouncing around garish neon landscape eating smaller snakes to grow bigger, here you\'re slowly plodding through a garish neon dungeon eating smaller enemies to earn basic ingredients to upgrade your own equipment.  Very slowly plodding.  On the upside, because this world is made of magic and electronic bits, there\'s a guideline constantly pointing you toward the next quest goal, so even when you\'re lost, you\'re not.\n \n Man, I wrote way more about this stupid game than I thought I would.  And that angers me.  It angers me that I\'m still playing it and it angers me that I could type this much.  Because I don\'t really like the game.  There\'s no plot, only one town, and the game totally cheats when you\'re playing the looting minigame.\n \n But I want to get back to playing it now, for some reason.  So, you know, whatever.\n \n It\'s okay.\n'

aS"\nThis item has wolves on it which makes it intrinsically sweet and worth 5 stars by itself, but once I tried it on, that's when the magic happened.  After checking to ensure that the shirt would properly cover my girth, I walked from my trailer to Wal-mart with the shirt on and was immediately approached by women.  The women knew from the wolves on my shirt that I, like a wolf, am a mysterious loner who knows how to 'howl at the moon' from time to time (if you catch my drift!).  The women that approached me wanted to know if I would be their boyfriend and/or give them money for something they called mehth. I told them no, because they didn't have enough teeth, and frankly a man with a wolf-shirt shouldn't settle for the first thing that comes to him.  \n \n  I arrived at Wal-mart, mounted my courtesy-scooter (walking is such a drag!) sitting side saddle so that my wolves would show. While I was browsing tube socks, I could hear aroused asthmatic breathing behind me. I turned around to see a slightly sweaty dream in sweatpants and flip-flops standing there.  She told me she liked the wolves on my shirt, I told her I wanted to howl at her moon.  She offered me a swig from her mountain dew, and I drove my scooter, with her shuffling along side out the door and into the rest of our lives.  Thank you wolf shirt. \n \n Pros: Fits my girthy frame, has wolves on it, attracts women\n Cons: Only 3 wolves (could probably use a few more on the 'guns'), cannot see wolves when sitting with arms crossed, wolves would have been better if they glowed in the dark.\n"

aS"\nTry, if you can, to put to one side GaGa's irritating self-obsession and her ridiculous delusion that she's somehow in on a 'party' and is 'sharing it' with us lowly non-famous people, and let's look at the album on it's own merits. Surely it can't be THAT bad, right? She has credentials, after all. She's worked with some respectable collaborators, after all. She can hold a note, after all.\n \n Sadly, none of this seems to have counted for much at all. What we have here is the very worst pop sludge, making it's ugly way off the predictable, unoriginal treadmill of weak pop music and into the mindset of the hysterical masses, whose purchases and subsequent success of that which they purchase fool both consumer and artist alike into attributing far more quality to a product like this than it actually warrants.\n \n Put simply, this is rubbish. Over indulgent, shallow and completely inconsequential rubbish of the kind we'll look back at in five years time and wonder what on earth so many people were thinking by buying it in large quantities. Presumably GaGa knows this already, hence her insistence on dribbling out barely coherent concepts of her fans being 'part of her lifestyle' (as if it's in any way desirable), and distracting us by flashing her body as if it adds anything other than something most women will cringe at and be rightly embarssed for her about.\n \n Given her past contacts, this really is unforgivable tripe. Its success is no justification for it's supposed quality. We all know that if the sheep are spoon-fed something and told it's good by radio stations and celebrity magazines, they'll inevitably lap it up thoughtlessly. Given how many artists are actually putting out decent music that gets overlooked because some trumped up nobody with favourable contacts and a good body puts out garbage like this, it's a real tragedy that everything other than quality seems to be the criteria that measures success.\n"

aS'\nIf you\'re looking for REAL heavy metal and if you are sick of that old fake crap (Megadeth, Dream Theater, 80s Metallica, Iron Maiden, Opeth, Queensryche, Borknagar etc - basically any of the clowns that only posers with no taste praise) then look no further. They show other talentless poser "metal" bands that solos suck and when they actually do solo - they do it better than any of those losers in the 80s. They show unknown posers with guitars like Malmsteen, Satriani, McLaughlin, Michael Romeo etc how to REALLY play an instrument. When I listen to this I feel soooooo deep. Like Amy lee, I am a tortured artist and too complicated and intelligent for the world to understand. That\'s why I\'m anti-authority and anti-mainstream.

aS"\nIt's obvious to me the positive reviews here come from White people fascinated with Asian culture (anything Asian must be exotic and intriguing).  Just look at the review entitled &quot;multicultural Braveheart with Kim Chi.&quot;  I don't see any reviews for Braveheart entitled &quot;multicultural First Emperor with Haggis.&quot;  There was no Kim Chi in this movie.  There was also no &quot;love&quot; here, either.  The movie had the potential to have a love triangle, but love was neither talked about nor seen.  The closest that came to &quot;love&quot; in the film was an obsessive-psychotic guy who threw a spear at anyone who dared come within a foot of the princess.  The princess was an annoying primadonna who wasn't worth anyone's time.  There was no character development, and there were too many fight sequences.  If you want to see a good Asian movie with a war epic and a real love triangle, see Hero.\n"

aS"\nThe Sonicare Essence series e5300 is a great manual toothbrush, not sonic. I say this because when it completely dies anywhere from 2-6 months from date of purchase, you will be using it as a manual toothbrush. I use mine in the shower. It fits great in my hand and has some weight to it (from the non-replaceable dead battery) so it's not as cheap-feeling as a flimsy plastic toothbrush. The bristles are also nice and compact and reach fairly well. The only downside is the price. At around fifty bucks it's a little steep for a manual toothbrush, but hey, you get what you pay for right? The build quality is way better than a cheap six dollar plastic toothbrush and replacement heads are only about twenty-five bucks per two pack. Find comfort in knowing that when yours dies (and it will) it makes a great manual toothbrush. Also, you can cut the electrical cord off of the now useless charger and use it for a cool-looking toothbrush holder! The only reason I gave it one star is because it is supposed to be a sonic toothbrush, but oh well. It still kicks butt as a manual one!\n"

aS'\nI bought this helmet for two reasons: disguise and durability. When you\'re out there on the streets performing missions, the last thing you want is for bad guys to recognize you. Or, worse, be able to knock you out with their lazers and baseball bats. Well this helmet, surprisingly, protects me from neither of those things.\n \n I put a lot of thought into this helmet before deciding upon it. As a vigilante crime fighter, I believed in the need for a disguise. That way, criminals couldn\'t find the real me in the phone book and hurt me in my house, or hurt my cat when I am not in my house (I\'d probably be out fighting other criminals). I also believed that the "missions" that are part of this helmet would help me train and fight crime with more creativity. But there are no useful missions. It\'s all weird stuff about zords. I have no idea what zords are, but they are no use to me when I\'m chasing down jewel thieves or wrestling drug dealers. Maybe someday I\'ll meet one of these zords and this training will come to some use, but I doubt it.\n \n Speaking of which, I have no idea what they meant for this helmet to protect me against. It\'s just too small, for one, and there\'s no way it could withstand the blow from a lead pipe or glass bottle. My enemies often use lead pipes and glass bottles in our battles, but thankfully I\'ve never taken a hit directly to this mega helmet.\n \n For that matter, my peripheral vision is just ruined, so I\'m often running down into dark alleys while flipping the helmet off and on just to make sure I don\'t trip over any hobos. This exposes my face for an instant, and an instant is all a criminal needs to recognize me or fire a sonic blast into my waiting face.\n \n And how do they expect me to fight crime with the shaded visor? Crime happens mostly at night. Night, as you may know, is darker than day. I don\'t need a shaded visor at night. What were the Power Ranger Engineers thinking when they designed this thing? Maybe over there in power ranger land they have very bright nighttimes, but not here. No sir.\n \n Then there are the sound effects. Look, guys, I\'m guessing that over there in power ranger land criminals are easily shocked and awed when you come at them with all kinds of futuristic sounds. But over here, they just laugh at me. Maybe that\'s the point. I don\'t know, but at least I can kick them when they are laughing.\n \n Now here\'s something else that\'s concerning: On the box there\'s some small child in what appears to be fighting stance 16B. It also says that this mission helmet is good for 4 years and older. I assume they really mean "4+ years of street-level crime-fighting experience", not someone\'s literal age. Notably this "child" or "small man" on the cover is wearing no other protection and is comically trying to fight crime with only his bare hands (in fighting stance 16B, no less! That\'s only good for battling frogmen!). I\'m an adult crime fighter and I wear shin guards at least, and also a very thick sweater if it\'s cold. Bare hands? Only if you\'ve had bioenhancements, such as adamantium reinforcements! If that was true, then why would this child need the protection of a helmet? It just doesn\'t make sense at all.\n \n This is just misrepresentation. For that matter, why is this in the "toy" section? Fighting crime is a serious matter, for serious people. Even if you have no intention of using this helmet in your crime-fighting adventures, there\'s a danger of being seen as a crime-fighter by criminals simply for wearing the mission helmet.\n'

aS'\nI\'ve really loved all the previous Jenny Cain mysteries by Nancy Pickard (with the exception of BUM STEER, which wandered all the way across the country from the New England setting).  Nearly all are witty, wise and well-written, satisfying all three of the "Important W\'s" of popular fiction.  In all the other Jenny Cain novels, even BUM STEER, the plotting is tight, the characters plausible, and although clues are dropped along the way, the conclusions aren\'t easy for a reader to figure out.   TWILIGHT\'s chief problem is that it\'s a clumsy mystery. Even the characterization seems weak in this book, and Jenny is by no means at her interesting, clever best. Even distracted by the Autumn Festival, how could she have misinterpreted Bill\'s odd behavior and remarks as "funny" when readers immediately know that something is wrong with his perception of reality?   And the main plot -- the hazards of an urban hiking trial crossing a road for vehicles -- makes a mountain out of a molehill.  It\'s unworthy of Ms. Pickard\'s doubtless gifts as a writer, since the persons who should have been consulted on the issue of road safety apparently never were when the trail was created -- namely, state, county, and insurance safety engineers.  My father was a safety engineer, who would have taken about one afternoon to recommend answers to the hazards of that fatal road crossing.  There must be quite a few safety specialists in Massachusetts since, when I lived in New England back in the 60s, there were plenty of road signs. There were also hiking trails, many of which crossed paved roads.  Didn\'t Nancy Pickard ever hear of multiple signs warning of pedestrian crossings?  Of blinking red lights?  Ordinary stop signs at the bottom of the grade, on both sides of the trail, would have prevented every one of the fatalities caused by the carelessness of a person who seemed not to wander from his own yard and driveway.   Look, I live in Philadelphia.  We have a long woodsy hiking trail winding along a scenic creek with urban neighborhoods on either side. Going from the Chestnut Hill neighbohood to the Andorra neighborhood, a heavily trafficked road crosses this trail -- and vice-versa.  This crossing is protected by stop signs, and elswehere by traffic overpasses.  Urban trails are, of course, inherently somewhat unsafe.  The trails in Philly are sometimes stalked by muggers and rapists, but if any hiker has been killed by a vehicle in the seven years I\'ve lived in Philly I\'ve never heard of it. I\'m sorry that the Jenny Cain series is at an end, but perhaps Ms. Pickard realized that something went wrong with this book.  I just wish Jenny had gone out like a lioness.\n'

aS'\nI was given the Three Wolf Moon shirt as a gift for my departure from my current job assignment.  Immediately upon donning the shirt, I was attacked by mobs of women at the pub.  My wife was actually trampled to death by the sudden rush of women.  Fortunately, the 3 wolves soothed my grief  . . . and taught me to fly.  After taking a quick aerial cruise around England, I returned to my compatriots.  It was a difficult landing, due largely in part to the throngs of women in waiting.  After using my laser vision to clear an LZ, I regained my Earthly contact (if you can call constant hovering "contact").  The Ancient Egyptians believed that the difference between a king and a pharaoh was that pharaohs were actually gods on Earth.  After placing the shirt upon my body, I was aware of the state of reverence in which pharaohs were held.  This was due in large part to the fact that all about me (approx. 300 people/worshippers) were laying prostrate before my holy visage.  King Tut has nothing on me thanks to Three Wolf Moon. \n \n I did notice a minor drawback to Three Wolf Moon.  It involved the inability to make things explode with my mind.  I felt it was a basic application of The Shirt.  Apparently, I bought a knockoff because my friend purchased Three Wolf Moon and was instantly able to blow up the head of the guy who was sleeping with his girlfriend.  I wanted to use it to destroy Fenway Park and allow Wrigley Field to be the sole historical ballpark, but apparently I purchased The Shirt from a different supplier than Pocahontas.\n'

aS"\nEver notice in some of the reviews of this and similar books you'll sometimes see people refer to these books as &quot;my bible&quot;...contemplate that for a  moment... As Old Order  Establishments, such as Christianity,  painfully pass away, New Religions  rush in to fill the Void and &quot;Rationalism&quot; is one of them. The  Old Order was convinced that there was something &quot;wrong&quot; with  being human, (i.e. Original  Sin, The Fall, Ad Nauseam), and  Rational-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,(sounds Orwellian doesn't it?), makes  the same mistake, though it pretends not to. Orthodox religion presented to  us what was and was not acceptable, what was and was not healthy, and  Rationalism has been quick to catch the falling garter as Old Dame   Christianity slowly passes into obscurity. Old Dogma is replaced by New  Dogma; but not to worry, it's New and Improved Dogma...&quot;Studies  Show&quot;...and all that jazz. But to be &quot;Saved&quot; you  &quot;must&quot;,(very un-Ellisan word, even if that's what he's really  saying), refute the self-defeating words in your head with New Mantras and  a New Outlook, and Nothing can be really THAT bad can it? Qualitatively  speaking, how does this Newspeak differ from the pronouncements of, say,  Bhagwan Rajneesh or any other would be Prophet with their  &quot;institutes&quot;, publications and Certified Practitioners, (Yes, you  can get a List of Certified Rational-Emotive therapists, just like you can  get a list of Christian Science Healers). There is something Tragic/Comic  about the image of poor folks walking the streets struggling to refute  their &quot;IB's&quot;, diligently doing their Charts  at night, trying  very hard to convince themselves that bliss is at hand, it's all in  &quot;The  Head&quot;.  I quite agree...just for different reasons. At a  time in my life when I was chronically hand-wringing about my life, about  what was &quot;True&quot;, whether I drank too much, about my tendency  toward the Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name and other Melodrama, my Best  Friend sat me down, looked me straight in the eye and  intoned...&quot;There's nothing wrong with you&quot;.

aS'\nFrom the opening pages of Tori Spelling\'s searing new memoir, "Mommywood," readers will realize that we are in for a rare tale of pathos and depth.  In that first scene, Spelling recounts the devastation and fear she experienced when, at a 3-D ultrasound for her first child, she realized that his nose looked too big.  Gigantic, even.  She could not believe that this horrifying defect, which could well destroy Liam\'s Hollywood career before it even began, went unnoticed by her husband and doctor.\n \n Spelling knew it was vital that baby Liam have a perfect nose, because she had made the noble decision to record his every smile, poopy diaper, temper tantrum, and birthday bash for all of America--no, the whole world--to see. On her reality show "Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood," which airs weekly on the Oxygen network, Spelling vents to fans about the tribulations of having two tiny children who are followed everywhere by the paparazzi she  invited into their lives. \n \n In the book, she reveals her fascinating quest to lose the baby weight from Liam even while getting pregnant with her daughter Stella.  She courageously opens up about her sex life. She trashes her mother\'s catty trashing of her and discusses Mom\'s shopping and wanton materialism. She reveals how, after redecorating their home, she realized it was far too small and bought a mansion instead.  She frets at length about the faux pas of arriving at a birthday party for celebrity twins with the wrong present because she had never actually met the children and didn\'t know their ages.  She also wonders aloud why it is that Luke Perry, her old co-star on 90210, snubbed her at another child\'s birthday party, finally concluding that it may have something to do with what she said about Perry in her last memoir, "sTORI Telling."  (Although it was only published a year ago, there obviously needed to be another memoir for 2009, because a lot has happened in Tori Spelling\'s life.  It would have been a tragedy had we not been told, for example, what Halloween costumes she chose to dress the kids in for 2008.)\n'

aS"\nIs there somewhere I can apply to get the time I spent watching this movie refunded to me? It started out merely predictable, but quickly became unbelievable, and eventually escalated into eye-popping nonsense. If you enjoy this, you should stick with TV movies. In terms of redeeming factors, there are some truly hilarious moments, such as the car chase where Dennis Quaid succeeds in driving one-handed through miles of narrow streets at high speeds while making non-stop cell phone calls and surviving, unscathed, some nasty crashes. Apparently, driving and talking on a cell phone is safer than we've been led to believe. We can only hope our actual Secret Service agents are one tenth as competent (and lucky!) as Quaid. And, we can only hope that someday, our actual President is as worthy of the effort as the mythical one in this story. By the end, I was slack-jawed in amazement at what passes for entertainment these days. I wish this movie had been made by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, or anyone else, with at least one foot in the real world. No such luck... but in the end, one dollop of entertainment was discovered, as I howled my way through the apparently sincere comments by the cast and filmmakers in the special features. If you finish this dog with a straight face, you must be on some of that stuff that Quaid took to steady his nerves... what was it? Maybe I needed some to sit through this movie.\n"

The actors portraying Japanese soldiers act like a bunch of twelve year olds who have never seen a gun go off before. They throw their hands up at the first sign of an American soldier without putting up a fight (yeah right!). In addition to all that, the history is all messed up. The US soldiers are portrayed as attackers when in fact they dug in and defended the island from the Japanese. What a joke.\n"

aS'\nMy husband and I have carefully selected a lot of "green" products for our home and especially for our baby.  We were thoroughly disappointed with these wipes.  When we opened the package, we couldn\'t help but cover our noses--they stunk!  We thought we would get used to the smell, but it was so vulgar--bordering on worse than the dirty diapers--that we quite using them.  Its a shame, because we\'ve liked other Seventh Generation products.\n'

aS"\nAs a former club DJ, I can personally say that this album is among the worst pop/dance albums I have ever heard. And I have literally heard thousands - from all over the world. I've been in this game a long time. And young Kesha has much, MUCH to learn. The lyrics are chock-full of drug and alcohol references, the vocals are auto-tune heavy, and the blips and blats of electronica that litter EVERY stinking track could have been put to better use.\n \n As a fellow reviewer mentioned earlier, the album lacks cohesion, as Kesha is unsure of herself at best. Lady Gaga, Cascada, and Kim Sozzi have better dance albums out right now WITHOUT all of the professional cooks who had their hands on this project....with Gaga it all boils down to her extreme confidence and exhuberance. She relies not on studio-enhanced vocals, name-dropping, and junior high school lyrics.\n \n One look at the song titles and it pretty much gives away the content of the album. THe lyrics are so ridiculous and pretentious that the listener cannot enjoy the beats and the melodies, which in certain cases are not that bad. The whole point of a dance-pop record is so the listener can dance away their troubles. These lyrics are so bizarre and unnerving at times that the focus is entirely on Kesha and her dirty party-girl image. Most people who buy dance records don't care about the vocalist. It's all about the mood and the beats.\n \n This album sounds like the songs were both written and performed by a 14 year old raver while she was in rehab or a mental facility. If I were forced to listen a few more times to this steaming pile of drivel, I think I would check myself into a facility. 1.5 stars.\n"

aS"\nIf you think the idea of watching a 40-something-year-old man attempt to minimalize his life to the nth degree could just be quirky enough to be interesting, think again. Written and directed by Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale), Greenberg is an exercise in cinematic endurance that tests the audience's patience to the breaking point. How long you last will depend on how interested you can force yourself to be in the lives of Greenberg and the people he passes along the way. Chances are you will snap long before the movie stumbles to its pretentious ending.\n \n [...]\n"

Just do a quick internet search on Kitchen Aid leaking oil and you'll get plenty of information - in particular that the company won't do anything about it, other than tell you to use your mixer more often.  Give me a break!!  Everytime I use it, I sit with paper toweling to catch the oil before it gets into the food.  No more Kitchen Aid or Whirlpool products in my house.\n"

aS'\nI was really looking forward to this game, man what a bummer. Now I know I\'m in the minority here but it\'s my take on this game and here it goes.\n \n Well, so far I\'ve put in at least 6 hours...6 hours of agonizing bordom! I just don\'t get what all the "hype" is about. It\'s almost as if you have to like this game or you\'re not "cool" by the way people talk about it. Guess I\'m not cool, I freakin hate this game.\n \n \n I actually restarted the game to go ith my lowered my expectations and see if I could bare through it. No go.\n \n The pace is so slloowwwww. My god people, how the hell can you deal with this? I would much rather read a good book than play this, it\'s far more exciting and stimulating.\n \n The graphics are just so-so, nothing great here. The animations pretty much blow, pretty clunky to say the least. AI isn\'t the greatest either. And it\'s so wordy, like I said, if I\'m gonna spend hours reading I would rather read a book.\n \n Maybe I\'m just spoiled when it comes to RPGs having an uber gaming computer and having played some pretty amazing RPGs.\n \n The break down of this game is as follows.\n \n 49% Talking\n 49% Traveling\n 2% Action/picking up trash\n \n I\'m so glad I got it used, I would really be ticked if I wasted $60 on this.\n \n You\'ve been warned.\n'

aS"\nAs a rabid, frothing cat lover, I picked up the CatGenie Self-Flushing Cat Box for a feral cat I found on the street.  He never did use the cat Flushing Cat Box for reasons I suspect have to do with a fear of metal parts.  I did everything I could for him to use the Flushing Cat Box but he refused.  It was later that I found out that he was blind in both eyes.\n \n The box itself is a superb, fake ceramic bowl type Self-Flushing Cat Box.  It seems to have a little camera which detects Cat movements and has soothing sounds of ocean breezes or other music you choose.  A little robot hand comes out to scoop the Cat waste and then shoves it towards the back where it accumulates for months in a smelly decomposition chamber that will make you vomit when you change it.\n \n I really liked the manual Flushing handle for a cat's paw, not too big, not too small.\n \n In all, you're still going to be doing tons of labor in regards to the Cat waste so you might want to consider the advantage of spending tobacco money on a small toilet that you stuff in the corner of your home that smells like a Formaldehyde fish bowl.\n \n Eventually I gave it to a midget friend because I had sold all my cats to the lab.\n \n"

aS"\nJanet Evanovich has cranked out 15 great Stephanie Plum novels, and if she's tired of doing it, that's her right.  Thanks for the 15 great reads.  But whoever thought they could keep a lucrative series going strong by finding someone else to write number 16 was sorely mistaken - because, as noted, you can't duplicate effervescence.\n \n Yes, the author has read all the other books.  Me, too.  Yes, the author knows that Stephanie is torn between two hotties.  I got that, too.  Yes, the author knows to include wacky characters and purportedly amusing scenarios.  But being able to write IN THE STYLE of Janet Evanovich is not the same thing as BEING Janet Evanovich.  I can write in the style of Mark Twain or Charles Dickens; it's just not going to be any good.\n \n Sizzling Sixteen falls as flat as Granny Mazur in an orthopedic boot.  Don't be fooled by the name on the cover; this isn't Our Girl.  Only question now is - do we trust that Janet will be back for #17, horrified by the literary crime committed under her name?  Or is it time to give up hope and lose ourselves in earlier volumes, enjoying Stephanie at her best and not subjecting ourselves to the pain of what must surely be ham-fisted fan fiction in print?\n"

aS"\nI am a tortured soul...No one understands me...my dad and mom force me to clean my room, force me to do my homework...etc., etc...woe is me...I listen to korn to get me through the long, harsh days of high school/junior high, and to get me through the long nights of my parents making me do my homework...the only people that understand me are in the band korn...\n \n Seriously though, I don't understand why this album is praised so much.  What did it do for anybody besides making 15 year old, zit faced kids depressed (for the most part), and the execs. who marketed this product so brilliantly?  Some argue that this album pioneered a wave of new music.  Even though this is somewhat (not entirely) true, what did it pioneer??? It pioneered Nu-Metal...hands down one of the worst genre's of music (with the exception of a few bands).\n \n I really don't care about metal having controversial lyrics for the most part, I like to consider myself open-minded when it comes to music, but this album, and ALL of korn's subsequent albums after this, have the same stupid lyrics/themes over, and over again.  Mom didn't love me, Dad did thing's to me, no one understands me, why me?, etc.., etc.  This has been going on for 10+ years.  They would probably be more respectable if they got a new topic/theme.  Davis though, who I assume writes the lyrics, has a lot to complain about.  He's a multi-millionaire, has legions of fans/easy women,..etc., etc.....No wonder he is so depressed (note sarcasm).  \n \n Korn also do not have much talent at all.  The vocals are equivalent to the sound someone makes when he/she gets shot in the ass.  Davis really needs to take singing lessons.  The guitarists are just plain bad and they pretty much use no more than three power chords in each song...In fact, why were there 2 guitarists in this band???  The bass sounds awful, and I don't care for the drums. \n \n In all though, this album was never good.  Try to check out some other worthwhile music that actually means something, and whose band members actually have talent.  For real music check out Opeth, Meshuggah, King's X, Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Symphony X, to name a few.\n \n      \n \n \n"

aS"\nI bought this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. I was very excited for her. I installed itunes on her computer (REQUIRED) and loaded it full of music, videos and apps. ITunes crashes a LOT and is VERY SLOW! Got it all loaded, she opened it, then none of the apps work! You click on an app and it opens up for about .2 of a second and closes immediately. The apps that come with it work, just none of the added ones. Well, Apple support was closed for 3 days until Monday! On the Apple site their wonderful support has you give them a date/time to call you back rather than just have help available. I went through like 5 horrible set up screens on the Apple web site to get them to call me back Monday to help with their broken Christmas present and WHOLA, the VERY LAST PAGE of the support site gave me some error message about the Apple web servers. Amazing. I think they need to re-do their ads that say Microsoft has buggy products. I am very computer savy and googled around and found the web REPLETE with similar problems. No solution worked except completely reformatting the ipod, creating a new account, and not letting itunes copy the apps for me. Then it worked. When it worked, I loved it. Therein is the problem. A 5 star product is a 1 star product if it is only good as a paperweight. Well, later that same day, we were adding apps and then the new ones started with the opening then immediately closing thing again. Reformatting and reloading everything twice a day is not a viable solution. I returned it.\n \n That is not all of my fun with Apple. I did like the product WHEN IT WORKED so I went to the Apple store at the Mall of Georgia near Atlanta, GA. I told one of the 'geniuses' my problem to which she said she had a similar problem. She then continued to be unbelievably rude with comments like 'stop interrupting me' when I was just trying to clarify what was happening with my product when she stated something different than what I was saying along with 'what do you want me to do?' along with a 'Want me to get the manager?'. I was amazingly calm considering the level of bad attitude. I then told her that all I wanted a warm and fuzzy. I just wanted to know that I got a bad ipod and that it is a rare condition because I wanted to buy one that day. She did not do that. I then thanked her for helping me make up my mind and went out and got a Zune HD and love it. It works great. I already own an older IPod 30gb and a macbook 13''. They work well but are NOT bug free and as simple as advertised. I will not, however, be buying a single Apple product ever again thanks to the unbelievable rudeness of the 'genius' and the problems I had with this Christmas present on Christmas day for my daughter.\n \n Also, the IPod is married to ITunes and the ITunes store. Most good media players give you access to the device for more of a tinkerer who wants to control the folder formats, what goes where, etc. Not a bunch of locked down, buggy, slow, DRM LADEN, confusing interfaces. The IPod makes you use ITunes. That DRM garbage and Apple only tie in junk proves it is Apple, not the 'evil' Microsoft that is all about the $$$. Hey, I'm a capitalist, but don't be so greedy and monopolistic about it. Anyway, I excecised my right as a Capitalist to go by a competing, easier, better product...the Zune.  And Zune has apps coming. Oh, and I have the G1 Android phone and love it. It has an app store, that went from nothing to a zillion apps in no time also. I bet the Zune one will soon also.\n"

aS'\nIf you are overweight, or even sensitive about your weight, don\'t read this book! Iovine can\'t resist saying "fat" without adding "and ugly" and she states in the beginning that overweight couch potatoes are not welcome in her circle of "girlfriends." Towards the end of the book, she discusses the pregnant waddle, and reasons that all fat people waddle a bit anyway. She sympathizes with her husband for not being attracted to her. After all, you wouldn\'t want to sleep with someone as fat as you, right? And she confides that her maternity wardrobe ran all the way up to a (gasp) size ten! The horror! Although this book was very entertaining and had some good information, I got tired of being slapped every couple of pages. The author simply can\'t resist seperating her temporarily round self from those of us who struggle with our weight all the time. Does she not realize that the average American woman is a size 14? I really felt like I was reading this book as an outsider, so I waited until a skinny friend got pregnant and gave it to her. And by the way, Ms. Iovine, I am a size 16 and my husband can\'t keep his hands off me. It would take a lot more than pregnancy and dark roots to push him away.

aS"\nThis book made me want to beat my head over a wall.\n \n Paul D seems to be the only sane character. Everyone else seems to have some mental issues. I couldn't relate to anyone or anything in this book. The plot was disturbing and creepy, and the writing was very hard to follow. I found myself staring at the pages to make my mom think I was reading it (I had to read this for a summer English assignment), but not actually comprehending the words. \n \n The only good part of this book is that it put me to sleep easily, so I got much more sleep than usual.\n \n Everyone talks about hidden meanings and symbols in this book, but I was too bored to even understand what I was reading.\n \n I love to read, and I loved reading Shakespeare in class, but Beloved? I'd rather eat dirt & watch the grass grow. It's extremely boring, and everything is just strange and wrong. Don't watch the movie either unless you like violence, insanity, incest, rape, cuss words every few sentences, bodily fluids flying every which way, and just all around crappiness. However, all of those things happen in the book anyways; you just picture them in your mind (which, unfortunately, scars you for life) instead of seeing them on a screen.\n \n While I was reading this, I kept thinking (more like hoping) that the book had to be ending soon, but then I would realize that I was only on page 30.

As the drama unfolds, we see that Blart doesn\'t get the respect he deserves from anyone in the movie. Several times I had to wipe the tears from my eyes as I watched the film.  Kevin James is a highly underrated actor in the mold of William Shatner as well as being an hilarious comedian. His role in "Mall Cop" is similar to Jackie Gleason\'s in "Smokey and the Bandit".

By the end of the movie, it seemed like there was a lot of suspense, but not the right kind of suspense.  I found myself with enough time between the character's lines to figure out what I'm doing for the rest of the week/month.  A lot of times the pauses in the dialog were filled by grunts, sighs, and heavy breathing, which is more than a little uncomfortable.

aS'\nI am the author of\n Striking It Rich: Golf in the Kingdom with Generals, Patients and Pros \n \n As someone who generally reviews things I like (I reviewed "Rushmore" but passed on "I Heart Huchabees" and "Lost in Translation") I am a little uncomfortable doing this review. \n I was a physics major at MIT and spent 2 years counting cards in Vegas and Reno after graduation. I was 21 when I started; the same age as the protagonist. I eventually tired of the card-counting lifestyle and went on to medical school. Chapter 3 in my book is entitled "The World\'s Biggest ATM". Its all about card-counting and my time at MIT. So I consider myself to be something of an expert on the subject matter in "21".\n Nothing is portrayed even close to reality in this movie. First of all, card counting itself is not that hard. Any student who can get into MIT can learn to count cards. Its not that mathematical either (in the Thorpe tens/non-tens system you have to do some quick division in your head but they were using a -1, 0, +1- type of system where you only have to add -1, 0 or +1 as each card is played). OK You have to have a good memory and be able to focus intensely without anyone noticing what you are doing. I happen to have a good memory. You probably do too.  It took me three weeks of learning the tables and practicing to become enough of an expert to be able to play in the casino for hours on end without making a mistake. And in case you\'re wondering...YES it works,\n But it is a job. With the systems now available, you can get an advantage of 2 or 3 percent over the house (the casino). It doesn\'t sound like much but if you play 100 hands per 60 minute hour at an average of $100 per hand, you have created $10,000 of "action". 3 % of that is $300.\n Per hour.\n And that\'s about how it works. To get $3,000 per day (more than $ 1 million per year) you have to play 10 hours; or you have to bet more. I played with my own money and needed to play with less at the beginning because you need enough of a bankroll (about 200 x your minimum bet) to make sure an unfortunate run of cards doesn\'t wipe you out. And unfortunate runs you do get at times. You only average $300 per hour in my example; sometimes  you make more, sometimes less. It\'s a fairly tedious undertaking that pays off gradually with time, time and more time at the tables.\n I wanted to love this movie- both subjects are near and dear to my heart- but I had heard that the book wasn\'t accurate either and I wasn\'t expecting too much. Even so, the movie (and book too- I eventually read it) fell far short of my low expectations . MIT wasn\'t portrayed accurately at all, starting with the two idiotic friends. That may be the characarture of MIT but it isn\'t anything like MIT. In my time there I never met anyone like that. The protagonist was pretty typical, nothing unusual in his abilities or background as MIT standards go. The Kevin Spacey  character could never exist; talking to another professor to get the kid out of an exam and give him an A. What!? And the casino scenes; oh the casino scenes... Those idiotic hand signals? C\'mon, the cocktail waitresses would\'ve picked up on those... Lawrence Fishbourne beating the tar out of people he caught counting!? I don\'t think so. The Nevada State Gaming Commission would shut `em down, pronto. (Getting caught cheating the casino with a dealer or by marking the cards, etc.- that might be different). But counting cards ISN\'T ILLEGAL. Its not against the rules to use your brain. \n In 2 years of playing on a regular basis (the casinos even pay for your flights and hotel rooms!) and sporadically after that- it really is addictive- nobody ever caught me counting; except once. That time, they just asked us to leave. They said we were disturbing the patrons.  "Gladly", we said, and just walked down the street to the next casino. Part of the problem with the movie is that its hard to make an entire movie about counting. There\'s just not enough material for a theatrical full-length feature film. (Its much more ideally-suited to a one hour documentary.) Ok, so what to do? Enter the two stupid friends and the side show about the 2.09 contest, the strip-joint girls cashing in the chips, ( I don\'t think so- a few of them might slip into the ladies room never to be seen again), the sob story about needing the money for medical school, etc. "Excuse me Mr. Future Doctor Millionaire, MIT math genius, Harvard Med Graduate,  don\'t take your mom\'s life savings, don\'t lie about the scholarship, just apply for a student loan like everyone else who\'s going to medical school." That\'s why it occupies only one of thirty-six chapters in my book . There\'s just not that much to the mechanics of counting and making it work in the casinos. The magic in counting cards is in the realization that it is a free ticket to as much money as you will ever want and that you will never have to work again. A "free" ticket? Not exactly. It turns out to be a job like any other. I made that clear in "Striking It Rich" and I too eventually went to medical school and became a surgeon. Who wants to count cards all day when they could do something useful (and if it matters to you) make the same amount of money in the process? Counting cards, MIT math geniuses, the very pretty female protagonist, etc. are all potentially sexy subjects but their sexiness was utterly lost in this book/movie. Where were the consultants who knew something about MIT? Casinos? One of our fine actors, Kevin Spacey, was a producer on this film. How could he let this happen? What were Spacey and the writers thinking?\n Nix the idiotic characterization of the kid who was making hundreds of thousands counting yet who insisted on stealing everything from bottles of booze to pens from the maid cart, and the entire team who was scared to try it without Spacey\'s corrupt professor at the helm... Uh, HELLO?- these are supposed to be our best and brightest, Mr. Producers...) A realistic portrayal of MIT students and of MIT, and of casino card counting could have been something  very entertaining. As  a lover of MIT, movies, card-counting, money, sexy, smart women, etc., all I could think was "What a waste!" \n \n \n'

aS"\nWow EA really jacked this one up. Sims 2 was probably the single greatest wide interest game ever made. Appealing to everyone from 8 year old kids to baby-boomers, there was so much right about the game (ease of use, the fun of designing and building custom houses, the excellent expansion packs, the fantastic user made content, etc.) that perhaps it would be unfair to expect Sims 3 to be better than Sims 2. However, I AT LEAST expected it to be playable, and reasonably similar to Sims 2 in quality and fun. To sum up the rest of this review: It's nowhere close. It stinks. It's unplayable due to crashes (for me at least). It's a buggy, unfun, massive step backwards from Sims 2. \n \n So what makes it so bad? \n \n First off, the game crashes nearly constantly. It is not my computer. I own and successfully play dozens of computer games including the most graphics intensive on the market. (For the nerds, I have a i7 processor, 6gb ram, and crossfired ATI HD4870s). These problems are due to buggy code and terrible beta testing. This game should never have been released in this state of unfinished unplayability. \n \n They have also removed many of the things I liked best about Sims two like the ability to construct a neighborhood from scratch and then play each family and watch your Sims interact, make friends and enemies, get married to each other, etc... You are now forced to play a single family at a time. Start a new family and your old ones become NPCs (non player controlled) characters. You can never go back once you start a new one. Why EA, why? This singlehandedly ruined the game for me. \n \n Next is the drastic step backwards in ease and fun of playability. Why they decided to jack with the control mechanisms that every Sims 2 player is accustomed to, or slow time down to the point that I started falling asleep watching my Sim sleep with nothing to do in the game to keep me interested, and why EA released the game with a deplorably low number of home furnishings, I don't know. It's like a horrible nightmare where instead of games progressing and improving, they're regressing towards oblivion. The menus are just clumsy, hard to use, and so very much worse than Sims 2. If you loved the Sims 2 menus, you will HATE these. \n \n The camera is also bad, in that sort of early generations Nintendo 64 way where you can never get it to do what you want it to do with regularity. It seems to have a mind of its own, and controlling it is as frustrating as the terrible controls. \n \n Making attractive Sims is about as easy as sculpting the masterpiece David from play dough. All my Sims look fat, ugly, and just not what I had in mind. It is Uber hard to get a face the way you want it to look. It is even harder to make a nice looking Sim than the character creation system in Oblivion: The Elder Scrolls. If you like plump, slightly froggish looking Sims, you'll love it. \n \n For interior design, rather than giving you a solid and complete set of home furnishings, you are instead offered very few selections, but the ability to make them patterned. Oh joy! What I really want is about 6 options of sofas, most of them ugly, but that I can apply plaid or camouflage skins to! That's so much better than having say 12 sofa varieties right? Not so much. This strikes me as either laziness, or that EA released the game intentionally sparse so they can sell even more add on packs later. Except they missed the entire point: the reason they sold so many add on packs for Sims 2 was that the core game was so good! \n \n Overall this might be one of the worst failures in modern PC game history. Destroying a famed (even legendary) series of games like the Sims franchise by changing core elements and just doing a flat out poor job of quality control is abysmal. EA will need to heavily patch this game to make it worth playing, and by the time they do that, it might be too late. \n \n My recommendation: sell your copy on an auction site. At least then you can get back some of your money and buy something else.\n"

It has been a constant source of frustration for me that my organic "turkey hat" generally goes rancid after only a few hours of wear. The fit becomes too loose and the turkey tends to slide down over my face frequently. Not to mention the unpleasant smell as the meat decays. Sound familiar? At long last, someone has produced a synthetic turkey headwear product that should alleviate some of the problems I\'ve mentioned above. Can\'t wait to try mine out this Thanksgiving.\n'

aS'\nLet\'s start off by saying that I am a big supporter of Apple and their products as well as a proud owner of an iMac, Macbook, iPods, and now the latest and greatest iPhone 4. And being the Apple fan (geek) that I am, I followed the live blog updates from WWDC 2010 a couple of weeks back to get the latest news on the unveiling of the phone. Announcements were being made for awesome new features like Facetime, Retina Display, etc. etc. and... drumroll please... a $29 piece of plastic combined with rubber that only went around the edge of the phone? Really? I mean, I understand that the back is left open for aesthetic purposes (baby got back) but I\'m pretty sure that when I drop my phone (and I will drop my phone), my phone is most likely going to land on the back or the front and not on its side. So... I did a little bit of searching and this product was one the of few that took advantage of the iPhone leak (thanks to the guy who "left it at the bar"). And it really did take advantage. Very good fit, durable material, cut outs that make sense. And it didn\'t cost me 29 bucks. What more can I say? It\'s a case that fits and does what it supposed to do which is to protect the phone. And apparently also prevent signal loss to people who hold it in their left hand (I guess you can\'t post links in a review but if you check out engadget, there are a number of articles that will convince you that a case WITH a closed back is very much needed to protect your investment). Apple should\'ve included the bumper in the packaging but hey, that\'s how businesses make money. So until they make a bumper where it can shoot laser beams or bring about world peace for a whopping 29 bucks, I think I will be sticking with this case.\n'

aS'\nTo say "Cop Out" is bad is to underestimate how excrable this movie truly is!  I can safely say that "Cop Out" is one of the worst movies I ever sat through; and I\'ve sat through some really bad ones.  Not only is the pacing poor, the rapport forced, and the acting awful, there ar less laughs in this \'buddy comedy\' than there were in "Julia and Julia."\n \n Bruce Willis merely goes through the motions and looks like he was having second thoughts in merely every scene. Tracy Morgan should be given the 2011 Razzie right now...He\'s that bad.  The plot is a mish-mash of Beverly Hills Cop, Fletch, 48 Hours, and Lethal Weapon.  The music has been lifted right out of Fletch and you\'ll be longing for even one moment as funny as the weakest moment from any of the above named films. \n \n Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like it was guaranteed to infect you with the Bubonic Plague.\n'

Any old rubbish will do as the fans desperately hold onto even the tiniest snippets of MJ.....the final hurrah.\n \n \n It is sad that M J has died (and I like his earlier stuff - I really did) but he had gone past his sell by date so long ago. (I particulary loved that one about the little bird in the tree....."rockin\' in the tree-tops all day long...."). \n \n That one.\n \n He really could sing and dance in those days - but after that? - Well - let\'s be honest it became very same-old - same old dance moves - with a couple of subtle amendments.\n \n YAWN.\n \n And this film just bunches them up together and throws in a few group hugs to boot. \n \n The poor chap is dead - Sad for his family - but come on people let\'s give it a rest now AND MOVE ON.....like the grown ups we all are.\n'

Ice Ice baby!)\n - Kenny G (he\'s sold more albums than any other instrumental "artist", so therefore he is better)\n - Ashlee Simpson \n - Limp Bizkit (created metal)\n -Linkin Park\n -Metallica (St Anger may be the best metal album ever that doesn\'t feature Fred Durst)\n \n This is what you should not get:\n \n -Miles Davis (this guy was a poser. Get Kenny G instead)\n -baroque classical posers like Mozart, Bach, Paganini, Beethoven, Chopin etc \n -self proclaimed "rock" bands ie Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, The Who, Queen etc\n -posers who think they can play the guitar (Segovia, Rhodes, Satriani, Friedman, Holdsworth, Reinhardt, Van Halen etc)\n - socalled "metal bands" like old Metallica, Megadeth, Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden\n -any of that "progressive" crap like Dream Theater\n'

aS'\nAs a Grey, I found this book to be entirely slanderous of me and my people and our mission on Earth. We are not here to "abduct" you, perform horrible experiments and make you doubt the reality of your own petty, wormlike existences. We are here as mere researchers, trying to discover what it is about humanity that makes you so... special. If the advice in this book were to be taken, why, our research would come to a complete standstill! Without subjects to study, how can we know more about you and your inconsequential lives? We are on your planet for entirely peaceful reasons, and not - I repeat NOT - here to steal your genetic material to build an invincible army to utterly annihilate those crustaceous scum on Alpha Centauri.\n \n What\'s more, it would completely mess up the fourth season of "Who Wants to Be an Earthling," and you really don\'t want to screw with the networks like that.\n \n Don\'t buy this book!

aS'\nWow what a way to start off your career with one of the best debut albums ever! This album is non-stop rock. And I don\'t mean fake rock such as The Who or Led Zeppelin; I mean stuff that actually takes TALENT to creat (those guys were just hippies on acid trips who have no ability to create good music). Ashlee can play instuments for the record, I\'ve even seen a picture of her with a guitar which proves it. She composed this music ON HER OWN and didn\'t just touch up her voice in the studio like these posers will tell you. Also you bitch about her lip synching. Well LOL everybody does it LOL. You should get this, but ignore talentless poser "singers" such as Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo.\n'

aS"\nIn almost every actor's career, there are some early film efforts that were clearly done just for a paycheck. If these actors had their way, these movies would be wiped off of the face of the earth and never mentioned again. \n \n Actress Alyssa Milano (who got her start on the hit 80's TV show Who's the Boss?) made quite a few of these type of movies early on in her hit/miss (but mostly miss) movie career. Most of them were essentially sub-par soft-core erotic thrillers (like Embrace of the Vampire) that just basically sucked on almost every level. Others were actually pretty good like Confessions of a Sorority Girl. Some may argue that she may have been trying to shed her wholesome image from her prior TV show Who's the Boss but I think that she was just desperate for work and would take anything she could get her hands on, no matter how bad the script was. Either that, or she actually thought that these were supposed to be good films. If that was the case she ought to slap her agent during that period! \n \n A friend of mine recently lent me her 1995 film Poison Ivy 2: Lily on DVD with the recommendation that it was good on a so-bad-it's good level. All I can say is that it was just bad on every level and actually made most USA Network sleazefests look pretty good by comparison. \n \n The film is a sequel (in name only for the most part) to the 1992 cult classic that starred a decidedly very sexy & 17 year old Drew Barrymore in the lethal nymphette role of Ivy. On a guilty-pleasure level the original movie worked due to the movie's reliance on solid acting instead of just wall-to-wall sex and nudity. \n \n Poison Ivy 2 involves Lily (Alyssa Milano) who is an art student/painter from Michigan who has just arrived in California to start attending an art school. She quickly finds a house that has a room for rent and quickly moves in. She starts attending her classes and quickly catches the attention of a male classmate. They start going out and it soon becomes obvious that Lily's much older (and married with a child) teacher has the hots for her as well and develops an unhealthy infatuation on her. Lily ends up inexplicably finding a hidden diary and nude photos from a girl named Ivy (presumably the one from the first film) and immediately becomes fascinated by Ivy's wild and free sexual ways. Lily immediately begins to start dressing in very revealing clothes and basically acting like a tramp, much to the surprise of her boyfriend (who doesn't mind one bit.) Her teacher ends up talking her into letting him paint semi-nude portraits of her and before too long he can't resist his urges and starts trying to force her into having sex with him. She tries to refuse and eventually her boyfriend catches on and gets disgusted with her. She tries to confront her teacher about it at her house and he tries to practically rape her in the main hallway (while his wife and young daughter are home no less). His daughter and wife catch them in the act(WHOA!! I didn't see that coming!)and the little girl inexplicably runs out into the street and gets hit/killed by a car(!). Everyone exchanges some heated words and the movie ends. \n \n The plot, as you can tell, is predictable and thoroughly generic. Probably the worst part is that the running time of the movie is an unbearable 108 minutes. Most of the scenes go on ridiculously long and will more than likely cause unsuspecting viewers to doze off periodically. \n \n All of the actors involved look like they were blackmailed into making this movie. Alyssa Milano is there purely for the skin factor and all of the other cast trudge through their roles looking like someone slipped valium in their meals/drinks. \n \n As is almost always the case with direct-to-video skin flicks, Poison Ivy 2 is available in both unrated and R-rated versions. The DVD I watched included both the R and unrated versions of the movie on the same disc as well as offering a choice between widescreen or full frame viewing options. The only version that I checked out was the widescreen unrated version. According to the back of the DVD box, the R-rated version looks to be missing around 2 minutes of explicit sexual content. To be honest, I couldn't really tell what about the uncut version caused the MPAA to demand cuts. Out of the whole film there are probably literally only 2 1/2 minutes of footage that feature any sort of nudity or sexual content. Even when sex does occur it's so poorly lit and the editing is so choppy that not that much is really shown. The sex scenes are also pretty brief for this dubious genre. There's one in particular that's good for a laugh in which a guy who is lusting after her confronts her in his room at some goofy party. (It is rumored that this particular scene originally contained an explicit shot of Alyssa simulating oral sex on the male actor who played her boyfriend but that she forced the distributors to take that shot out of the film. The very beginning of this scene is present as you see her head makes its way down, but then it cuts away.)   \n \n Since this was an unrated film, there was tons of room to make a truly erotic and extremely explicit sex scene. But what we get is something that isn't that much more than we see in most R rated erotic films. Any shots that showed below the waist sexual activity usually only lasted for a second or two. (The only scene that probably could have ruffled the ratings board's feathers was a brief sequence in which the sleazy teacher performs oral sex on Lily.) All of the participants are clearly not that comfortable with the material which makes the few sex scenes boring, laughable and about as far from erotic as you can get. I've seen R-rated films that were a ton more explicit than this. \n \n Once again, my main beef with erotic thrillers is that if you know you're making an unrated film, just go all out and make it as sexually explicit as you can.\n \n As can be expected, the sole reason most people will watch this movie is to see Alyssa Milano nude. While she looks great with her clothes off, it's clear that she wasn't all that comfortable in those scenes and she just looks flat out embarassed in the sex scenes. And to be honest, she's not naked all that much in the movie. When she is it's mostly just shots of her fabulous breasts (with a few moments of her toned bare butt), but unfortunately no full frontal. People would be better off just downloading the stills off of the internet instead of trying to make it through this piece of crap. \n \n This direct-to-video dud is a thorough waste of time and really isn't worth watching for any reason whatsoever. For a film that advertises itself as soft-core porn, it is sorely lacking in the sex and nudity departments and features instead some of the worst scenes and acting around. Only Alyssa Milano addicts will find anything worth salvaging in this mess, everyone else should just act like this movie doesn't exist. \n \n Poison Ivy 2: Lily is unrated and contains strong sexual content, nudity and language. \n \n (as mentioned before the R-rated version is 2 minutes shorter and edits some of the more explicit sexual footage while also using some alternate camera angles.\n \n"

aS'\nZzzzz... yet another movie with terrific CGI, a garbled plot, no human emotional connection, and a mixed bag of awful to above average acting.  I actually started to fall asleep at various points in this movie....\n \n One\'s senses are not quite as assaulted as with "Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen", but this movie falls into that same class of an action movie hyped mainly for its special effects and yet unable to hold our attention just on that basis.  Yes, there was a time, back in the days of "Jurassic Park", when merely seeing this awe-inspiring CGI onscreen was enough to keep a moviegoer awake, but no more.  Nowadays, terrific CGI is so ubiquitous that it is easy to be blase about seeing it onscreen;  the CGI nowadays is just part of a movie\'s landscape, like the potted plants and furniture.  \n \n Enough, my eyes and ears tell me, so what if the Kraken/Medusa/Giant Crab/Monster Du Jour is attacking - do I care enough about the characters and plot that it means anything?  Without that essential emotional connection to the story and characters, watching massive quantities of CGI is just as sleep inducing as watching potted plants grow. \n \n Sam Worthington is in this movie, which might be enough to keep his fans awake, but I am baffled at how he has managed to become a mega-movie star in such a short time.  A published critical review of his performance said that his CGI "Avatar" character had more facial expressions than he did in this movie.  Another said that his acting was so wooden that it belonged in the lumbar section of the Home Depot.  \n \n Mads Mikkelsen was one of the few actors to squeeze a capable performance out of this movie, as Draco, the co-leader of Perseus\'s merry band of monster-chow.  Kudos to him for managing to retain his dignity, much more than Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes were able to do in this movie.  The presence of these two stars bring to mind the latter days of Sir Laurence Olivier, who was willing to appear in almost any bad movie as long as they paid his fee.  I would love to know just what was going through Liam Neeson\'s mind as he was walking around in that silly mirror-polished suit of armor and scraggly beard.  Come to think of it, he did once do both in "Excaliber"... so maybe that\'s what he was thinking.  Ralph Fiennes - has playing one of the most effective evil Nazis of all time onscreen ("Schindler\'s List") made him a lock for all the blockbuster Evil Bad Guy roles in Hollywood?  Take the money and run, is what seems to be going on here. \n \n One interesting visual effect of this movie was that all of the males were tanned a dark shade of bronze, whereas the two main female characters were left strikingly pale, which made me think that in the time of the Ancient Greeks,  men and women were of different races.  Or, perhaps the women were just locked up indoors all the time.  Both women were cute and did a decent job in their roles, but the shag rug carpet  which Io wore in her last scenes made me want to burst out laughing.  Poor Gemma Arterton.\n \n Yes, the costume designer for this movie was beyond horrible.  I could go on and on about the horrible costuming.  \n \n Even worse, the Continuity Director must have been on drugs during the entire shoot.  Or maybe it was just really bad film editing, combined with a fractured screenplay.  Did anybody else notice the beautiful shot of sunlight breaking through the clouds....... during the total eclipse?  Right, it does get awfully dark during a total eclipse, and that entire Kraken vs. Argos scene (with Alexa Davalos getting strung up as Kraken food) should have been in the dark, or twilight.  \n \n But then, almost nothing made sense in this movie.  The initial entry into the palace of the King of Argos - was it a festival or something?  What was with all the music and dancing girls?  Perseus and his group journey into Hades - Charon is mentioned, but barely seen - not enough left in the budget for a better Charon?  Then, having crossed the River Styx, they are not in Hades, but in Medusa\'s lair.  WTF?  And when Perseus comes out, he is seen exiting a cave.  What happened to recrossing the River Styx?  \n \n More questions - Why is Pegasus black?  What happened to Calibos\'s hand? (an interesting teaser, watching his hand come back to life... and then nothing).  Why is it mentioned that Medusa can only turn men to stone, not women, and then the Kraken gets turned to stone when it sees the Medusa head? Does the Medusa head turn fish and crustaceans to stone also?  How about insects?  And oh dear me, WHY IS MEDUSA WEARING A BLACK BRA?  Imagine putting a bra on your pet snake, yes that\'s what that looked like.\n \n And of course, one cannot go through the list of what\'s totally bad in this movie without mentioning the obligatory Hollywood caricature of the Extremist Religionist, who is stuck into this movie like a sore thumb.  He appears as this skinny bare chested guy with mascara eyeliner shrieking in a British accent about offering up Andromeda as a sacrifice.  In between trying to stay awake, I could only groan and sigh "Not again" at the grating appearance of this character....\n \n There were lots of things like that which made me want to close my eyes during this movie...\n \n \n'

aS'\nPutting this movie in your player can clear a room faster than a Fire Alarm. It was apparent when HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I was released that Mel Brooks had blown his comedic gift, but I doubt anyone expected the man behind the truly great YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN to bottom out as completely as he did here. Witless and torturously unfunny, with nearly every tired, corny gag ponderously telegraphed minutes in advance, (It\'s...the...Statue...of...Liberty...                                                                 "Planet...Of...the...Apes"...joke...coming...up...in...a...moment).There\'s really no way for me to convey how unremittingly awful SPACEBALLS is. When I saw it in the theater, I can recall only two genuine laughs in the entire picture: The never-endingly long spaceship that just keeps on passing by at the beginning, and the "One Froggy Evening" / Looney Tunes reference during the ALIEN parody. I believe I spent the rest of the time retching.You\'d be better off watching your toenails grow than punishing yourself by sitting through this mess.\n'

aS'\nThe Nintendo Wii has been stated by many to have revolutionized gaming as we know it.  A drastically deep claim to make in such a powerful entertainment medium that revolves around technology.  A claim, that I believed as well.  The idea of playing games with motions is intriguing, enticing, and exciting, something that many use as a decision maker when it comes time to purchase a console.  I was one of the many people who waited in line all night November 18, 2006 for the Nintendo Wii.  \n \n After taking it home that first morning, I was dying from anticipation of playing the newest console made by Nintendo.  I opened the console, I liked what I saw.  The Wii Menu is unique, and is a great way to navigate the console.  The menu displays the contents of the Wii\'s internal hard-drive, displaying items such as downloaded games, and new channels that may have been purchased.  Navigating the menu requires the usage of the sensor bar and pointing the Wii Remote at the screen to choose the desired channel.  \n \n The games feel unique at first, requiring motions to control on screen avatars within the games.  However, as time goes by, the feeling of revolution is replaced with tedium.  After a few hours of gameplay it becomes obvious that button presses of the past have simply been replaced with simple gestures that do not represent the actual on screen action.  For example: in past games in order to attack you may have been required to press "A" but the Wii replaces this with a simple "shake" of the controller.  It doesn\'t even matter as to which direction the controller is shaken in either, seeing as the gesture will not match the onscreen motions.  The majority of the games on the Wii really only use five different gestures, simply recycled over and over again.  These gestures include: shake controller left, shake controller right, shake controller up, shake controller down, and thrust controller forward.  These gestures do not actually allow the gamer to feel immersed in the game, since these gestures are no different than button pressing.  The added drawback of these motions is the inaccuracy of the detection of them as well.  \n \n Where I started to lose faith in the Wii was after picking up some hardcore games for the console.  I began by purchasing Resident Evil 4, Okami, Madworld, No More Heroes, Mortal Kombat Armageddon, Dragonball Z Tenkaichi 2 and 3, Twilight Princess, and more.  I started to realize that with these games, precision is an absolute must.  However, the Wii remote\'s motion controller actually takes away from the precision due to the poor detection skills of the controller.  This results in lag, delayed moves, incorrect moves, and more.  In several of these games, I found myself repeating missions and levels simply due to the fact that the Wiimote would make my on screen character perform the wrong moves.  For example:  in Twilight Princess, the shield bash is done by pushing the nunchuk forward, however, sometimes this registered as the nunchuk being moved to the side which corresponds with a spin attack.  Similar scenarios began to play out with all of the Wii games I purchased.  Every game began to get more frustrating and I began to play my Playstation 3 more and more.  Finally, I came to a conclusion, traditional controls just work better for playing games, period.  \n \n The graphics of the Wii are fine, in my opinion, despite the lack of HD.  Graphics alone do not make a game fun, and that is why I continue to play PSOne and Nintendo 64 games to this day.  However, the unresponsive controller gestures of the Wii are enough to turn me away from the console.  I\'m still hoping that Microsoft and Sony don\'t try to follow Nintendo too much with motion control gameplay seeing as it actually makes games more difficult and frustrating to play.  If you\'re a gamer looking for a console with great games, is a lot of fun, and can be played for hours on end with full precision and control, don\'t go with the Wii.  You can\'t go wrong with either a PS3 or a 360 though, both offer a wide variety of games in every genre and both respond the way you tell them to.  The Wii may have enough perks to attract you if you stick to games such as Super Smash Bros Brawl, Guilty Gear and other games that allow the option of playing with either a classic remote or a GameCube controller, but not enough games give players this option.  Also, if you\'re not looking for games that contain in depth controls, than perhaps you will do just fine with the Wii.  The Wii has its ups, and its downs, but for me personally, it has been a disappointment.\n'

aS'\nThis is a serious review.  I\'ve spent 13 of the last 15 months defending freedom as a U.S. soldier serving in Iraq.  My friends just sent me a care package which included Three Wolf Moon (size Medium).  When I took it from the box I didn\'t know anything about the shirt\'s magic powers or special abilities, but I immediately recognized it as the sweetest graphic I\'ve ever seen printed on fabric.  I was shocked when I was showing it off and a fellow member of my company identified TWM as a cultural phenomenon/enchanted garment.  To know that my friends loved me enough to send me a t-shirt that one reviewer described as being "woven from the same material as Chuck Norris\' beard" made my heart leap.  Repeated reviewers described TWM\'s abilities to stop bullets and resist flame. Being that I still have three months left of my tour here - and based on the recommendations of my fellow amazon.com shoppers - I will be replacing my body armor with TWM.  I feel that not only will TWM provide me with better ballistic protection, but it will also be much cooler during the upcoming summer heat.  Thank you wolf pack, thank you amazon.com, and thank you Three Wolf Moon.\n'

aS"\nI saw a wolf shirt that spoke to me like a shirt with a saying on it. I loved it. It loved me. (see Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt, Available in Various Sizes ). That shirt was ok... but it's THIS shirt that reaches deep into my soul, punches it in the face, and wakens it. That's when my soul (half wolf) leaps out of my body, ripping through the shirt, and into your lives, forever. Like Rocky... as in Rocky 5. It's beautiful, and it has you by the throat.\n \n With the powers of this shirt, I sired three offspring. One Caucasian, one African-American, and one Chinese... all with the same woman and/or gestation period. And for all those domestic-vehicle-driving jerks who say you don't have to wash wolf shirts, you couldn't be more wrong and I am insulted. I wash this shirt EVERY SINGLE DAY (when I shower) and it has yet to fade! Dove powers over Dawn like a wolf parade on a lazy sunday.\n \n I wore this shirt to the beach, went swimming in the riptide, was bitten in the face by a shark. How awesome is that?!\n \n But, this shirt isn't about the powers it inherits. It's about the respect I receive while wearing. I once passed another man-soul who bore the mighty lone wolf shirt (he must have been me, and me him, during a powerful astral projection session in our evening sleep. It WAS a full moon that night). We met eye-to-eye, hugged, and cried for hours. It was moving. People were walking around us.\n \n To sum this review with three words: I LOVE THISSHIRT! Please make more. \n \n Pros: Wolf. Soul. Grows mullets. Calms Babies.\n Cons: I'm too sexy for this shirt. But that's ok.\n"

aS'\nPicked this up to read on the beach. My criteria in this genre is that it has to entertain me while I work on my tan. Even horrible books fulfill this, if they manage to get me to turn the pages. In a way, Cocktails for Three managed this feat as well, as I was turning each page waiting for one of the three women to exhibit some form of development. Nada. It was really a disaster of a book in this case. Over 300 pages, it is nice to see a character grow. Instead, everything wrapped up and we were really no different off than we were on page one.\n \n Let\'s start with Roxanne. She was agonizing over how much longer she wanted to be "the other woman" in her long time affair with a married man. In the end, it was over because he was dying and wanted to live out his days with his wife. Not because Roxanne got some self esteem and realized that she deserved more. Not because she got any moral pangs about what she was doing. It just ended in the most contrived way possible. What did Roxanne learn from the situation? Instead, she\'s going to be mourning for the lover that she thought was dumping her, but was really just dying instead. I feel bad for the next in line of her relationships, because she\'s going to have a load of issues. Luckily, for you men out there, she\'s fictional.\n \n Candice. I just didn\'t get her. The whole plot with her getting taken advantage of and screwed over by a girl seeking revenge was actually one of the better parts of this book. You knew the girl was up to something right away, but it was fun watching it play out. What I really hated about Candice were the constant anti-capitalism/consumer remarks she made throughout the whole book. Things along the line of whining to her neighbor that he shouldn\'t be taking a paid leave of absence from work when there are people unemployed, or that he should sell his house out in the country because some people are homeless. Where was that attitude when she was hanging out with her friend Maggie, who had a 20 acre estate? Or when the girls were out at the very posh Manhattan Bar, ordering drinks that probably were 8 quid a piece or something outrageous? And finally, if the author wanted us to believe that Candice had this selfless attitude where she wanted to help everyone, having her fall for neighbor AFTER she found out he drove an expensive car and was wealthy isn\'t a way to reinforce her supposed lack of materialism. It\'s almost as if some of these things were thrown in as an afterthought.\n \n And finally, there is Maggie. As a career woman, I can understand the lack of desire to be a stay-at-home mom. However, I don\'t think I can emphazize with the character. Maybe, if we were just once shown that Maggie had any feelings of love towards her own child, I could relate. But all of her struggles were her own doing because she was afraid of perception. She wasn\'t ever worried that she wasn\'t doing enough for her daughter, but rather that people would think she wasn\'t such a superwoman afterall. Yes, Maggie. You probably are better off in the office. I disliked the way she just announced to her husband that they were moving back to London. Great communication there, hun. After moaning about how you never agreed with the choice in the first place, maybe you would have treated your husband with the respect you wish you had been treated with. Nope. Instead she does him just like he did her. There really was no maturity with this woman. And I want to pretend that I didn\'t read the page where she was really judgemental of the other neighborhood mom, calling her a "stepford mum". It\'s so obnoxious when women in powerful positions have no other way to enjoy that power than by letting the world know that she is better than another woman who did not choose her path.\n \n OK, so I\'m a little bit annoyed by a Sunday afternoon beach read. But for my $11 and 300 pages, I do expect just a little bit of actual writing ability. I will not be sampling any of the shopoholic series.\n \n'

aS'\nAlpha male.  Lone wolf.  Leadership. \n   \n These are just a handful of the words I would choose to describe the Wolf Gaze t-shirt (available in various sizes).  Furthermore, I concur 100% with the reviews of the two previous pack leaders regarding the potency of this garment when it comes to the ladies.  My story is as follows... \n \n Recently, I was invited to an 80\'s theme party at a campus sorority house.  Knowing that every frat boy d-bag with a faux hawk, tribal tattoo, and crotch rocket would come to the party dressed as Zach Morris (big cell phone, double popped collars, white-washed denim, etc.) I desired a chance to really set myself apart...from the pack.  Naturally, my selection to accomplish this goal had to 1) be wolf-related, 2) project a certain subtle sexuality in its theme, and 3) be a bold color.  Boom!  Wolf Gaze.  Size large.  Piss yellow. \n  \n Admittedly, I did cave slightly to the 80\'s theme and rocked a pair nylon track pants and Reebok Pumps (hey, even the `lonest\' of wolves has to roll with the rules of the forest).  That said, my look was achieved and a vibe was emitted.  Beautiful babies dressed in poofy prom dresses were admiring my status as the alpha male all night long.  \n \n One girl in particular caught my eye from a distance and the hunt was on.  Her hair was frizzy, her earrings were huge, and her outfit was all shades of neon...just my type.  As I went in for the kill, it was as if the power of the Wolf Gaze took over and not only impacted her inner urges, but dictated the song selection as well.  The lights dimmed, the strobes kicked on, and the sweet, sweet sounds of Duran Duran\'s "Hungry like the Wolf" filled the room.  Needless to say, the night ended successfully.\n \n In conclusion: buy the Wolf Gaze, be the lone-wolf leader that you are, get chicks.  If needed, Duran Duran is always available for support.\n \n'

aS'\nEverything is bad in this movie.....where should I start with?\n \n 1-EXTREMLY LONG!...the "climax" of the movie is like a torture, a normal lenght will be 10 ro 15 minutes, but in this one is like 40-50!!! and all because the stupid Autobots dropped Sam 25km away from Optimus spare parts!! I mean....could they be more stupid?? They could have left him near, but NO, it was a battle field, and he was defenseless.\n \n 2-TOO MUCH COMEDY - Parents, twin robots, bumblebee,fat computer nerds, conspirancy crazy guy....little decepticons....dumb giant robots.....Its amazing but the list can go on and on!!...arrogant teacher from THE OFFICE....Totally stupid! And there wasnt a single fun joke or scene between all this characters, in fact their attempts were so lame it was pathetic.\n \n 3-SQUARED CHARACTERS - No need to explain, all characters are robots (including humans) all predictable, all cliche, all repetitive.\n \n 4-THE CONSPIRANCY WAKO GIVING ORDERS TO THE ARMY - WTF??? Since when a civilian gives orders to the armada for using a secret weapon???\n \n 5-THE FLASHBACK OF THE MACHINE - we can see how the old autobots were having their AA meetings, and lots of caveman around it..and it was all surrounded by mountains....turns out thats Egypt...ya...there are so many mountains on Egypt today.\n \n I could keep forever, but I erased from my memory most of the stupidities I saw, this are the worst that cannot be removed, and will torture me for the rest of my life.\n'

aS'\nFirst of all, I HATE 3rd person games where shooting is involved.  Someone talked me into getting this game.  I should have known better.  You get ONE walk through on how to do a duel.  I have no idea how the heck I made it through the first one.  \n \n Another thing I hate is games with a lot of cut scenes.  Oh my God but you have to wait a friggin\' hour before this game finally gets through all of its opening cut scenes and lets you finally play the game.  (I exagerate here only slightly)\n  \n Fast forward to tonight.  I played the game for two hours.  I go through cut scene hell, pushing cows (lots of excitement in that), roping horses, and figuring out how to stay on them to break them.  It says "stay centered" but the screen jumps around so much you can\'t figure out what is centered.  I finally get through all of that and take my new horse to town.\n \n Now, when you first load the game, it tells you it has an auto save and gives you the option to turn it off.  So, of course, I left the auto save on.  Rockstar\'s definition of autosave is apparently not the same as mine.\n \n After getting my new horse to town, I run into a guy who wants to duel. OK.  I saw that it gave me a walk through last time, I\'ll get one this time just like you do with poker, right?  Wrong.  Nothing.  I hit one button and I\'m dead.  Guess what else?  No friggin\' auto save.  I\'m right back to where I was 2 hours ago.  I will have to go through all that stupid cow herding and horse breaking again, with all of its associated and asinine cut scenes.  I snatched the game out of the xbox, put it back on the shelf, and it will likely stay there for quite some time.\n \n This game sucks.  Period.\n \n Edit: I found a how to dueling thread on [apparently, Amazon won\'t let you post a link, but it is on reddeadDOTnet -- see the comments for the actual link] for those who are going to buy this game anyway and those who already have it that may be as frustrated with the lack of instructions as I am. It helped me figure out the dueling system.  Whatever you do, don\'t ask for help there without searching the threads or the fanboys will be on you faster than they are here on Amazon.\n \n Second Edit: I am forcing myself to finish this game.  This space will catalogue the various glitches, bugs, and annoyances that I find with the game as I go along.  Will these get fixed in a patch?  I hope so, but I doubt it.\n \n 1.  Despite what is claimed in the comments to my review, not every cut scene can be skipped.  The larger ones can be skipped by pressing "a".  However, the more constant and smaller cut scenes such as looting, skinning and picking flowers/herbs cannot be skipped by pressing "a".  What I have found, at least with skinning is that if you stop your horse just to the right of the animal and dismount on top of it, it will SOMETIMES skip the cut scene.\n \n 2.  Broken camera angles.  This is the major failure of ALL third person shooters.  In this particular game, it means that in a confined space (in a building, mine, or some such area) you can be looking at whatever it is you want to shoot and have the dot on the target, but when you pull the trigger the round hits whatever object you are standing next to.  This can get you killed in a hurry because while you can\'t hit the target, the target CAN hit you.\n \n 3.  The instructions, both in-game and the manual, are pathetic.  As some of the fanboys have said (with a perverse sense of pride that I cannot fathom), the game leaves you figuring out a lot of its controls through trial and error.  Error in this game means you die and go back to your last saved area.  Sometimes this means completely across the map.  That\'s a heckuva price to pay for trial and error.\n \n 4.  Senseless mission fails.  There are ways to fail missions that make no sense and cannot be avoided unless you know about them.  In the first horse roping mission, for example, if you get too far away from Bonnie, you fail -- even if you are pursuing one of the horses you are supposed to catch.  You can fail the barn burning mission by bumping into Bonnie (you "assaulted" her), or jumping the fence on your horse (you "terrorized the townsfolk").  \n \n 5.  Crashes.  After learning my lesson the hard way about autosave (it has now failed me twice), I am living by the mantra, "save early, save often".  After completing the main story line mission that involves assaulting a fort, I immediately ran from the fort (because the game will not let you camp/save in a town, on a road, near water, on slanted ground, or any hideout), got to an open area, hit my improved campfire and the game froze.  Hard lock.  I had to reboot the xbox.  And guess what?  I had to do the entire mission again.  I think this technically counts as the third failure of autosave because it did not save the game after completing the mission.\n \n 6.  Following the chatty NPC.  Many of the mainline missions require you to either walk with the NPC or go on a ride with him while he talks about all kinds of crap.  Some of these rides are ridiculously long and involve you just sitting there, holding down "a", and correcting the steering every now and again because the autofollow is even less reliable than the autosave.\n \n 7.  Teleporting bear packs. Someone needs to give Rockstar\'s programmers a biology lesson. With the exception of mating season, bears - particularly grizzlies - are solitary animals. They do not hunt in packs. There is an open area in Tall Trees where the bears not only hunt in packs of five at a time, but their reinforcements teleport from God knows where to appear right behind you if you try to skin one of their comrades. After getting killed twice by bears appearing out of nowhere, I had the camera angle up high and looking nearly straight down so I could see what was happening. A bear popped out of the ether right behind me and proceeded to maul me before I could do anything. If hunting here, do NOT try to skin a bear until you have killed at least four of them. \n \n UPDATE:  It appears that I was wrong on my numbers.  I shot a bear near Tanners in Tall Trees that started an endless loop of bears.  They popped out of thin air in ones and twos, and kept coming until there were no less than 25 bears dead on the ground.  In one place, I had four of them piled up dead on top of my dead horse.  The spawns came about 2 seconds after the previous wave died.  I found that the only way to skin was to wait for one to pop far enough away from the ones you had already killed, leave the live bear alone, and try to skin before he noticed you (using the no cut scene trick helps).  They kept coming until a random encounter popped up in the middle of it.  They stopped right after that.\n \n I also hit this same loop further down the road from Tanners in an open area across the trail from the area where Jack goes to hunt bear.  I died before they stopped coming because the random encounter that popped in the middle of that one involved a bunch of guys shooting at me while I was trying to fend off two bears.\n \n 8.  Inexplicable horse deaths. Another skinning issue I guess. I got off my horse to skin a deer on the edge of a messa. There was nothing in the area except me, the horse, and the dearly departed deer. As the skinning cut scene started, the horse whinnied and fell stone dead, passing right through me as it did so. I guess it couldn\'t stand the sight of blood.\n \n 9.  Aiming.  The LT locking feature is about the only way to get through this game, but its got some serious problems.  As an example, I had a bear coming at me.  I pull LT.  Guess what our hero, John does?  Aim at the bear you say?  Wrong, says I.  He points his gun straight up in the air and aims at some harmless passing bird.  I had to hit dead eye quickly, bring the aim down manually, and dispatch the bear before I got turned into lunch.  That\'s not the only aiming problem.  Get a gun with a scope.  Pull LT.  You can have a target dead center on the screen and the scope aims at the ground a few yards in front of you.  This bit of stupidity makes using scoped weapons all but useless in combat.  About the only place you can use it and hope to survive is the first couple of shots in a long range battle.\n \n 10.  The ending.  Lame.  Completely and totally horrid.  I don\'t want to post a spoiler, but they have Marston do the most asinine thing I have ever seen in a video game.  I mean, really.  Good grief.  You guys couldn\'t think of a better ending?  Oh, and if you do play this game through to completion and want to keep playing it, make sure you let the ENTIRE credits roll.  \n \n 11.  The 100% completion achievement.  I\'m sitting at 95.5%.  Guess what the .5% is?  Bounty missions.  You have to successfully complete a bounty at every bounty location on the map.  The problem?  The assignment of a bounty area is completely random.  I\'ve been trying all day to get the last three I need in Mexico, and all I am getting are the same sites over and over again.  3 more missions and I can trade this stupid game in.\n \n FINAL NOTES.  I\'m still trying to get those last 3 bounty missions so I can get the 100% completion achievement.  While it is entirely possible, I do not believe I\'m going to see anything new that warrants editing this review again.  Having completed 95.5% of the game, I can make my final observations.\n \n I will plagarize the first one.  RENT this game before you buy it -- particularly if you don\'t ordinarily like 3rd person shooters.  Don\'t buy the hype, this game is not that great in my opinion.  If you rent it, and you conclude that I\'m wrong, you can always go buy it.  If, however, you agree with my opinion, you have saved yourself about $50, and the time I will have spent doing battle with the fanboys will have been worth it.\n \n Second, to say something nice about the game, the graphics for the world are outstanding.  This could have been a great world to play in.  Kudos to the people who designed the sandbox.\n \n Third, the game still sucks.  Maybe not "period" (because of the gorgeous sandbox), but it still sucks for all of the reasons I listed above.  A pathetic 1 out of 5 stars.\n \n OK, ONE MORE FINAL EDIT.  I am now at 99.7% completion and have been for a week.  I need three more bounty missions in Mexico.  The way it works, the name of the bounty doesn\'t matter, it is the location where he is holed up.  You have to get all the LOCATIONS.  The problem?  It keeps spawning the SAME THREE MISSION LOCATIONS.  It has done this for a solid WEEK of real time.  It will not give me anything but three of the same locations over and over again.  It doesn\'t matter how I complete the missions it gives me (kill or capture).  It does not matter where I get the missions from (there are three locations in Mexico to pick up bounty missions and I\'ve done all three).  This achievement is COMPLETELY BROKEN because the game is stuck in an endless loop of the same three bounty locations.\n \n I really wish I could give this game a zero.\n'

aS"\nAs far as I can tell, there are only two explanations for this book.  Either Klosterman was trying to write a satire of what a self-important, but not very intelligent a**hole, would write in a series of essays or Klosterman is a self-important, but not very intelligent a**hole.  I'm going w/ the later.\n \n Just a few examples:\n - In one of the essays Klosterman argues that soccer will never make it big in America.  On this point we agree.  His argument based on his failure as a little league baseball coach.  Apparently, Klosterman tried to be one of those hyper-intense coaches who tried to work out his own personal daddy issues by trying to turn a team of 9 year olds into a finely tuned baseball machine.  Because this didn't work out, and Klosterman might have a problem with women, soccer will never make it big in America. Um, okay.\n \n - Klosterman's discussion of math and probability would embarass a stoned 16 year old with it's facile reasoning.\n \n -  Like other writers of his generation, of which I am part, Klosterman has somehow confused an obsession with, and Rainman like recall of, certain pop culture elements (cereal, Saved by the Bell, The Real World)with actual knowledge and understanding.  Perhaps one day he will read a book or see a movie created before the 1960s.\n \n \n"

aS"\nI bought this album for my Fiancee's 25th birthday and I know she was greatly looking forward to it. However, a few days later, she suffered a brain hemmorage and was rushed to hospital. For many days she lay in a coma and I feared the worst. And then, late one night, I began playing this album to her and the moment she heard Katie Price's amazing voice her eyes began to flutter. By the end of track 3 she was sitting upright in bed, tossing her hair - and by track 5 we were making love like wild stallions. Needless to say, for both of us, this timeless and extraordinary album is little short of a miracle!\n \n PS: Since writing this review, I have learned that my fiancee DID listen to the album many weeks before and this may, in fact, have caused her brain to nearly explode. However, this has done nothing to reduce my admiration for Ms Price and I look forward to her next album - 'Songs for Cross Dressing Cage Fighters' - with great relish!\n"

aS'\nLong time fan of the Lego Games by Traveler\'s Tales. I loved Lego Star Wars, Indy was good. Batman was my favorite. I must confess, I never played Lego Indy 2. Though, a disclaimer, I do not like the inspirational subject matter of this one near as much as the others, so it was already at a disadvantage. However, this game is so poor that I felt the need to tell everyone. \n \n This game is just too buggy and repetitive for me. Perhaps its the subject matter, but the lack of character depth and variety in this one is just disappointing. Just basically the three main guys (Harry, Ron, and whats her name) with an occasional other guy. \n \n That aside, it might still be a decent title. The huge problem with this one is the finicky controls and bugs (and I\'m not talking about spiders crawling through the woods). The point and shoot interface of the Wii seems to be a little moody, especially when there is a clump of stuff you want to shoot. Once you lock on to one target, though you can add additional targets, you still have to shoot. That means if you accidentally lock on to another Hogwarts classmate, but you wanted to shoot a potted plant, you have to just shoot the classmate. Most of the time this doesn\'t matter, however, if they have been shot already, and they are provoked, this makes for an unneeded attack. \n \n Also, if you are in a level where the game is counting towards "True Wizard," if you shoot a bunch of stuff at once because you are already locked on, you will not have time to grab everything before the studs disappear. \n \n The next issue I have with this game is the purple floating spell. On multiple times, this has happened. Sometimes you have to levitate an object, and float it to another spot on the screen. Sometimes, it gets stuck, and you have no choice but to restart the level because you cant even float it out of wherever it is stuck. For example, in the level where Ron and the girl are chasing Dobbie in the Quiddich stadium, there comes a point you have to levitate a heavy ball, and connect it to a hanging rope to cause the gate to go up. Well, if you (either accidentally or mistakenly) put the ball into the ladder hole you climbed up on, the ball gets stuck. It is not stuck in a physical sense, because the spell is obviously trying to move it and when your character climbs on it, the ball spins in place, however, you cannot attach the ball to the place where it needs to go to advance. Guess what? You just wasted 10 minutes of your life getting to that point. There is no way to reset the ball. You must just restart the level. This also happened to me on the level where you fight the giant spider at the end. There is a rain cloud near the beginning you must form. I didnt move the rain cloud high enough into the sky, and tried to move it over to the statue. It got stuck, so I had to restart the level, as you cannot advance without doing it properly. \n \n My next big issue with this game is the save feature. Several times, I have finished levels, watched the outtro video, and turned it off, only to find that I have to replay the level the next time I come back. Why? Because not only must you watch the end of level cutscene to save it, but you must then either select to go back to the Leaky Cauldron or on to the next level. Then, and only then does the game save your progress. This is counter intuitive to me. When I turn off at the end of a level, I dont want to go to the next chapter OR go to the Leaky Cauldron. I just want to turn it off. But I get to go back and play again. \n \n The last gripe I\'ve got is the parts where you have to lift something, spin it, and send it flying again. There are two that come to mind. First, when Harry gets to Ron\'s house and you have to flip the gnomes (or elves, or whatever) and then again when you fight the giant spider. This is so confusing and counter intuitive the way this is done, you will die many times (on the spider, not the gnomes) before you luck into hitting it 3 times. It is just frustrating. \n \n Dont get me wrong, the level layouts are great. The music is great, and the graphics are great. To me, when a game has so many problems, it frustrates you to play it, that means its time to put it down, dust off the old Lego Star Wars or something, and play a game that is not so problematic. \n \n For a die hard fan of Harry Potter, it might be worth it. However, if you are just a die hard Lego _______ (insert movie franchise here) fan like me, I would pass on this one.\n'

aS'\nSpend $22.50 a year and save $10,000? How does that work? Well, a couple of my close relatives have spent well over $10,000 each having their teeth and gums repaired. If you\'ve had periodontal work or had root canal, implants, crowns or bridges done, you know that figure is not an exaggeration, and you\'re lucky if your insurance covers even a little bit of it. Having seen my relatives go through that, I\'ve decided that as I get older, I want to spend my money on vacations and real estate, and not on painful dental procedures. \n \n That\'s why the Sonicare is the most frugal product I\'ve bought. I too have had some costly dental work, and I\'m determined to keep my fixed-up choppers in tip-top condition. This toothbrush is amazing. One thing very few people note about the Sonicare is that it not only cleans your teeth beautifully, it also keeps your gums in great shape, and that may be even more valuable. Here\'s the best testimonial to the Sonicare: I recently had braces for a few years. I mentioned to my orthodontist that I\'d graduated from high school in 1983, and she said, "You\'re not that old." "Yes, I\'m 40," I said. She actually checked my chart! "Well, your teeth and gums look like they belong to someone in their 20s!" she concluded.\n \n Please invest wisely and don\'t skimp on dental care. I\'ve had other electric toothbrushes (Oral B) and tried every kind of tooth cleaning brush, powder, and gimmick you can imagine. This is the one I\'ve used for the last 5 years (I used the earlier Sonicare model for about 5 years before that), and this is the one I\'m sticking with. My annual checkups confirm I\'ve been making the right choice.\n \n Incidentally (inci "dental" ly?), Amazon\'s price on these heads is excellent -- much cheaper than my local pharmacies. A two-pack will last a year, since these heads wear out like clockwork at about 6 months. That works out to a little over $1.85 a month. Heck, you could spend that on regular toothbrushes!\n'

aS"\nThe Room is the greatest film ever produced.  Writer/director/producer/actor Tommy Wiseau is a jack of all trades visonary genius who could very well be the offspring of Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg.  Call him the Hitchcock of black comedy, the Orson Welles of symbolism, and the Martin Scorsese of sex scenes.  His foresight knows know limits.  He will plunder your heart and soul and leave you on the floor, breathless, panting for more of his vivid and penetrating mis-en-scene and astute aural pleasure enchanted with both harmony and discord.\n \n You will call off work the next day.  You will find yourself living a life that cannot possibly be real.  You will begin questioning metaphysical reality as you find yourself trapped in a void of hate and condemnation.  Hate because you did not think of creating The Room first.  Condemnation as you relive your past failures.  \n \n But while The Room will have you calling into question the insane lament that you now find yourself dangling by, you will elope with your new lover and find solace in it's affair, it's tortuous ownership of your heart.  Such is the masochistic nature by which you must now live.  But do not fret!  You will worship The Room's takeover as a necessary love-hate balance which, in time, you will discover is truly a microcosm of the universe's chaotic beauty.  Embrace it, but never coddle it.  It is your new mistress.\n"

aS"\nApparantly my first review was censored by Amazon, so here goes again.  This movie is, by far, the worst film i've ever tried to watch.  I say 'tried' because after two separate attempts I couldnt bear to watch more than half of the film.  This is coming from someone who gave Eraserhead 5 stars, so take this as a very bad sign.\n \n Long story short, Andre is self-absorbed and does nothing but talk endlessly about insignificant, flaky, artsy stuff.  For example, imagine the most self-important Art major you've ever met talking about how hot-gluing scraps of trash to a canvas represents the struggle a ham sandwich about to be eaten.  Or anything completely nonsensical such as that, that is the level of conversation these men have in this film.  I watched this movie because it was compared to a scene in Linklater's Waking Life (which was intelligent and thought-provoking).  IF you pay the absurd amount of money they are asking for this DVD, there is something wrong with you.\n"

aS'\nWow!  So much better than playing school or house for brainwashing---I mean,  acclimatizing today\'s tots to the realities of the Global War on Terror.  I especially appreciated the enclosed signed photo of Michael Chertoff and his letter explaining how necessary it is to start educating today\'s youth early with toys like these, especially as their elders just don\'t seem to be taking the whole thing seriously, what with posting snarky reviews on Amazon and all, and it\'s going to take a while to get KBR\'s re-education camps in Nevada up and running properly.  I know my little four year-old grandson was really impressed with this set.  He\'s now so scared it\'s undone a whole year of potty training and he\'s now wetting his pants about five times a day.  He\'s back to playing with his old set of wooden blocks Melissa and Doug 100 Piece Wood Blocks Set  and crying "Make the bad man stop, Mommy!"  Last week he saw Mr. Chertoff talking about terrorists on his parents\' fancy new plasma TV and he threw first the Playmobil set, which didn\'t do much damage, and then the wooden blocks, at the TV, which cracked the screen.   His dad, who worked at Countrywide Finance, was just laid off, so it looks like they won\'t be getting a replacement plasma TV.  I\'m taking the broken TV, the Playmobil set, and the photo of Michael Chertoff to the toxic waste dump tomorrow.  I have an old black and white set and pair of rabbit ears in my attic which I will loan them.  Perhaps it\'s better this way.\n'

One of these "coupons" was for a food chain and said merely "Come try our many seafood creations."  That\'s not a "coupon."  That\'s an ad.  And, I don\'t want ads popping up while I\'m driving.  Next, in case you want to use your Garmin GPS to (of all things) TRAVEL, you now need to buy a travel case separately.  And, Garmin is more than happy to fill that need for you for and extra $20-30.  Bogus.\n \n Now to the device itself (comparing it to an older model Nuvi).  The battery does not perform as advertised (maybe get 1 hour of nav). The traffic would show green as I was stopped in bumper to bumper (SF Bay Area freeway with plenty of FM Traffic reception).  The touch screen is way off, and the buttons are small to begin with.  You can now more effectively use computer software to put addresses into the device to circumvent the sub-par on-screen input, unless you have a Mac and the software has very limited ability (Google maps has better utility than the Garmin software).  Screen brightness on this device is poor in bright sunlight, made worse by the horrific glare off of the "anti-glare" coating.  The UI is less intuitive than the older device.  For example, the commonly necessary volume adjustment used to be: 1) tap on the power button, 2) tap desired volume level, 3) tap "back."  Now the process is: 1) Tap Menu, 2) tap volume, 3) tap, tap, tap, until you get the bar to the volume level you want, 4) tap done, 5) tap View Map.  Given the quirkiness of the screen, it ends up being more like: 1) tap menu, 2) tap back because it took you to the wrong place, 3) tap menu again, 4) tap volume, 5) tap volume again because it didn\'t respond, 6) tap back because it went into settings instead of volume, 7) tap "No I don\'t want to erase everything" because it tapped some mystical "Destructo" button somewhere in a Settings menu that you never meant to navigate to, 8)...\n \n Get the picture? Thank goodness to Amazon customer service that I\'m not eating this purchase.  If I\'m going to get sub-par construction and quirky UI performance, I\'m going to go get it from another brand where at least I\'ll save some $$$.  Maybe I\'ll use it to "try many seafood creations."    :)\n'

aS'\nWhy didn\'t someone think of that before?! For all these years, people have been suffering from the "turkey neck."  I bought one and CANNOT believe how well it works!! I haven\'t stopped pointing out my newest self improvement feature to everyone I know. I now have the firm straight chin of a Marine Drill Instructor. I no longer have fatty flesh along my neck hanging like the man boobs of a sumo wrestler.  My neck is now my favorite feature apart from my cankles. A day after using the Neckline Slimmer, I can no longer turn my head any direction but up or down, and I LOVE the fulfilling sensation of a solid 2 minute workout. And I found  other applications; I used the Neckline Slimmer as a pogo stick for my hamster! She bounced around for hours until the cat had enough. I used the low pressure spring as a shock absorber in my new Michael Kors  heels. And, the European cream is better than  the wax on the furniture and tastes great on Rocky Road ice cream!! Thanks Neckline Slimmer for helping me lose 200 pounds!!! Bye bye triple chin!!PS, It finally feels great to not be mistaken for Rosie O\'donnell now a days :)\n \n I haven\'t been this happy with an online product since I bought a wolf-moon t-shirt last year.\n'

It's a pity they couldn't have crashed the boat into the pier and sunk right at the beginning as that would have saved us from sitting through two hours of this rot masquerading as high drama.

aS'\nPanasonic failed to update its marketing details for this model. It was sold with the promise of full compatibility with Viera Cast, with a URL listed. When one goes to the Viera Cast Web site to find out what Viera Cast includes, they see Netflix and Skype, with NO mention that these only work on *certain* models. They may not be making more of these models, but they are still in circulation, being sold new at places like Walmart. Only after a person checks numerous sites for reviews, and googles tech news, does one learn that Netflix and Skype are not included. Deceptive, wrong and infuriating. If our wii from several years ago can integrate Netflix, Panasonic should be able to do the same. They also promised that Viera Cast would be upgradeable, so that buyers of the original models did not have to worry about their model being obsolete. Liars. I will never buy another Panasonic product. There are plenty of other brands that are loyal to their customers.\n'

She also proved that she is one of the best guitarists every in the contempary cinema classic Freaky Friday. Have posers like Al Di Meola had their own movies where they document their so-called "great" guitar playing?? No. Do you know why? Because they suck. The Muzak on this album is some of the best ever. Lohan along with Avril Lavigne are the two best guitar players in the world. They are better than those "classical" posers who don\'t look cool at all. The drumming shows wannabees like Peart and Bruford how it should be done. The bass shows self-proclaimed bass "masters" like Stu Hamm that crappy "inversions" (I don\'t know what that means) and lame techniques like "tapping", "counterpoint" and "slap and pop" (I have no idea what these mean either) are just crap that losers with no talent do.\n \n If you do not like this then you have bad taste.\n'

aS"\nThis is truly a spectacular movie in the tradition of Showgirls and Battlefield Earth.  It is one of those movies in which you know the people both on and off screen actually THINK they are making a quality product, but the result is so horrifying as to make it magnificent. Everything about this movie, including, but not limited to, the cheesy and overdone soundtrack (minor key, I should feel sad right now), the horribly written dialog, the wooden delivery (there were a few scenes where I swear Affleck was reading off of a cue card), and the incoherent plot, make this movie one for the ages.  While I don't think it really deserves it's current position as #1 on the top 100 worst films of all time on IMDB, it is definitely in the top 10.   I saw it in the theater with about 6 other people and we all could not stop laughing.  Truly a trainwreck of a movie.\n"

aS'\nWhile this is still a very good show, it\'s already come dangerously close to jumping the shark (jumping the Sook?), in just it\'s second season.  I wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars but that\'s not possible here. I just couldn\'t bring myself to give it four, so I went with three.\n For starters, the show has veered much too far off on a tangent concerning the Maenad Maryann, and many, many viewers have been frustrated by it. Too little time was spent on the vampires of Dallas, which I found to be far more interesting.  Too much attention was also spent on the Jason/Fellowship of the Sun arc, which was a deviation from the book series. All in all, there was too much "filler" to get to the good stuff.\n The penultimate episode (#11, "Frenzy") was a disconcerted illogical mess with few highlights, and the portrayal of the vampire Queen of Louisiana, despite Evan Rachel Ward\'s beauty, left much to be desired, for whatever reasons. I think Holly Valance, who played "Lola" in the (now regrettably defunct) Moonlight episode "B.C" would\'ve worked out better. "Frenzy" is widely regarded as by far the worst episode of the series so far, for various reasons.\n \n Still, inevitably, many characters have been been interestingly further fleshed out from the first season, adding depth to the series; notably, Eric, Pam, Sam, Jason, Tara and her mother, but mostly the effervescent Lafayette, played by the very talented Nelsan Ellis.  While many deviations from the books have been made, some good, some bad, the decision to keep the character of Lafayette alive was definitely a good move. We also get to see, briefly, the darker, more powerful side of Eric. Anna Paquin is playing the role she was born to play, she just shines in her role as Sookie, and all in all, the cast is amazing, despite some lapses in judgement this year from the writing staff.\n \n \n'

aS'\nGlenn Beck is at the forefront of the Republican purity purge. He\'s constantly denouncing this or that GOP politician for deviations from his ideological line. Recently, he extended this into the past, attacking Teddy Roosevelt as a RINO because he once made an inoccuous comment about being in favor of wealth as long as it was acquired by means that weren\'t socially destructive (apparently Beck is in favor of socially destructive behaviour as long as it produces wealth for someone).\n \n And yet, he\'s done the reverse here: he\'s tried to claim an icon of the Left as being on HIS side. Tom Paine, whose objection to onerous taxes was a) that the burden fell too heavily on the poor (so he proposed hiking taxes on the rich, including a top land tax of 100%) and b) that it was spent on court placeholders and the war machine instead of being used to help the unfortunate ("defense", meaning offense, is the one area Beck WOULDN\'T cut if he were in power). Paine practically _invented_ the redistributive purpose which is precisely what Beck and his ilk hate so much about tax.\n \n The Beckbots lap this stuff up. They\'ve never read any Tom Paine: they\'ve been told about Common Sense by someone who didn\'t understand it, and they don\'t know that he wrote anything else. Even the First Part of The Rights of Man would probably be too egalitarian for them; if they ever read Part Two (OMG socialism!), or The Age of Reason (ZOMG atheism!), let alone Agrarian Justice (OMFG communism!), their heads would explode. One might think that, once Mr Beck had told them the name, they\'d at least look it up on Wikipedia. Do they have no curiosity at all? Are they actively afraid of learning anything?\n \n The Right can\'t have Thomas Paine, Mr Beck. You might as well try to claim Karl Marx.\n'

aS'\nI understand that most of the reviews are fake and I would like to say that while I find them all very enjoyable and humorous, there is a something that a real customer of this product feels should be known.\n \n I purchased 10 of the rabbits for the purpose of making hare jerky (a tasty treat) when I was overcome with the desire to indulge in a bit of rabbit meat before the smoking process. Giving into my guilty urges, I took one rabbit for my own personal pre-jerky consumption and proceeded to eat the entire animal whole (I do not own a stove, only a plastic box and some firewood for smoking things, hence it was uncooked). After my little personal rabbit fiesta, I laid down to digest the food.\n \n This was a mistake. Within two hours, I had never felt worse. I used the trusty search engine "Bing" to do some armchair medical research while clutching a trashcan in the most horrendous gastric distress you can imagine (I do not have health insurance so I did not call the hospital). Quickly, I found out that a side effect to eating rabbit was "protein poisoning," a situation that arises when lean meat is eaten. It is also known as "rabbit starvation" because rabbit meat contains almost no fat whatsoever. Apparently, consumption of large amounts of protein with little or no carbohydrates or fat is dangerous. Well you imagine how much that tickled me angry. All ready to write an angry letter of protest to the rabbit meat industry about their marketing of a dangerous foodstuff, I stumbled to my writing desk but alas, I only made it 3 feet before collapsing in pain. The next 5 hours were like a blur as I lay on the floor writhing in my own waste seeing people and things from the past and quite possibly the future. I have experimented with drugs back in the day and let me tell you, nothing came as close to disconnecting me from the universe in the worst way possible, as this. No one ever wants to experience protein poisoning, I promise you.\n \n At about 10 in the evening I came to and used a chair and the wall to help pull myself off of the floor. I still felt sick and I went back to my computer to see if there was a cure. Suddenly it hit me, I needed to eat other macronutrients! I remembered the tub of lard I had been saving in the fridge and stumbled across my apartment. The pain only grew worse. I remembered reading that bodybuilders eat lots of protein. I have no idea how they do it. It must be horrible for them. My vegan friend has always said that anything over 20 grams of a protein a day is overkill and I\'m inclined to believe him now. He is the healthiest person I know, he is very skinny but he doesn\'t have visible muscle (which he says is the result of toxins and not enough body fat to properly survive). I finally reached my fridge and reached in for the I Can\'t Believe It\'s Not Butter container with my stockpiled lard. I quickly shoveled it into my mouth and wouldn\'t you believe it but it only made me feel worse! I passed out again, the cold air of the fridge blowing onto me.\n \n I awoke three days later (according to my watch) at 7 at night. The fridge had apparently preserved my body as it fought the proteins for the first night but now my electricity was off because my bill was due yesterday. It didn\'t matter, my body had apparently started to win the fight around 2 nights ago and now I am pretty much back to normal. However, I SINCERELY DO NOT RECOMMEND RABBIT MEAT as it can potentially kill you, as it nearly did me.\n \n Five stars - 1 for nearly killing me - 1 slightly chewy - 1 no head + 1 made great jerky = 3 stars\n'

aS"\n[Spoiler alert.  Nothing overt, but I do touch on the ending indirectly.] Burning questions for anyone who liked this movie: Q. Why does Ringwald appear repulsed by Cryer the first time she sees him? A. So that the audience can identify with her, even though it turns out they're best friends. Q. Why does Ringwald's best friend disappear halfway through the movie? A. Because the actress died.  But that's no reason to keep the scenes she shot, with no explanation of the character's disappearance, and then scribble new material for Annie Potts' record shop supervisor as the new best friend in the second half of the movie. Q. Why does Spader look like he belongs in college, not high school? A. Because he was clearly too old for the part, although he was otherwise perfect. Q. Speaking of Spader, why has he been chasing Ringwald for years if nothing about people outside of his social status appeals to him? A. Plot point Hughes thought he had to have, but it's actually unnecessary. Q. Why are we supposed to think that Ringwald's perfectly decent house is trashy and shameful? A. Because audiences would presumably be repulsed by genuine poverty.  (It's also a mystery why she's so ashamed of it if she rejects the values of her snobby classmates so vehemently.) Q. Why in the novelization does Duckie get the leading lady and not in the movie? A. Because the writer of the novelization knew what the only real logical ending was.  Hughes mistook gloss over substance again, as he did in &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; where Ally Sheedy's transformation from quirky indivualist to Barbie doll was supposed to be a good thing. Q. Why, if the characters' emotions and actions are supposed to ring true, does Potts almost blind a customer with a staple gun? A. Because cheap, easy laughs are excused by audiences raised on sitcoms and music videos. Q. Why, if Cryer and Ringwald are in the same grade and therefore presumably the same age, can't he get into the same nightclub she can? A. Don't ask me. Q. Why is the father played by Stanton such a weakling? A. It's required in any movie from the late 70s on where a child or teenager is the protagonist.  Has there been a parental figure in movies in the last 25 years as charming and authoritative as Ferris Bueller? Q. Why would anyone hire an actor whose idea of emoting is to press his lips together and bulge his eyes out? A. Ask Andrew McCarthy's agent. Can I recommend anything about this movie?  Yes.  Cryer is genuinely appealing in his best role.  The soundtrack still kicks.  And the climax (moments before the ending itself falls apart, when you think the right thing is about to happen, before it doesn't) is genuinely touching, because Duckie deserves happiness and Andy deserves Duckie.\n"

aS'\nWilliam Hurt cannot read.  At all.  The cadence, inflection, and emotion of Hurt\'s reading are inappropriate in almost every circumstance, and the accents he attempts are laughable.  I pity the first-time audio listener who might mistakenly pick up this lamentable reading and be turned off audiobooks altogether.  There should be a warning label, "Danger, listening to William Hurt\'s reading of "The Sun Also Rises" is known to nauseate expectant listeners".  \n \n On the brighter side, I have listened to many other wonderful readings of Hemingway\'s works including "True at First Light" read by Brian Dennehy and "A Farewell to Arms" read by John Slattery.

aS'\nPolk makes great speakers (LSi series), good speakers (RTi series), ok speakers (Monitor series), and mediocre speakers (R series).  But like most speaker manufacturers, their subs are horrible for the money.  Why?  Because they are betting that if you are already buying their speakers, you\'ll likely want to buy one of their subs too, especially if some slimey and/or ignorant salesperson tells you that you MUST "match" the sub and speakers.  \n \n Of course, those of us who know something about audio know that aside from a few rare exceptions (like Magnepan planar speakers which really require a super-quick musical subwoofer) there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUCH THING as "subwoofer-matching"---just get the best-sounding sub you can afford.  The best bang-for-your buck subs are made by the two dominant Internet-direct subwoofer specialists, Hsu and SVS.  \n \n This PSW10 is a prime example.  If you are in a small room and listening to jazz or rock music, it\'s not too bad.  Use it while blasting hip-hop, or watching a special-effects loaded movie like "Jurassic Park" or "Fellowship of the Ring" and you won\'t even know it\'s there---it simply does not go low enough nor loud enough (let\'s not even talk about if it\'s clean enough) to do the job.  The only worse mass-market subs I\'ve ever heard would be the Sony and Yamaha subs; the Infinity subs are slightly better.\n \n For this price range you can do much better looking at the 12" Dayton subwoofer from partsexpress dot com which goes for under a hundred fifty dollars shipped.\n'

aS'\nI have been fasting, on water alone, for 17 days now, and I plan to withdraw to consumption again when my body tells me I should.  On every page, the wealth of Colbert\'s ignorance astounded me.  What he has written is secondhand drivel from health books popular in the 80s, which advised readers not to drink water during a meal, because it would "dilute the digestive enzymes and interfere with digestion."  Anyone who has opened a middle school level Biology book knows otherwise.  How is this guy a doctor?  \n \n \n He is FUNNY, however.  I often found myself laughing out loud reading this.  He appealed to the Bible and yet obviously prefers juice fasting in almost all cases, and even prohibits absolute fasts (which I\'ve done dozens of times).  \n \n None of the fasters in the Bible "juice fasted."  Many of the spiritual leaders in the Bible did "absolute fasts," which Colbert expressly prohibits, even if God calls you to it.  So I wish Colbert would make up his mind.  Why does he advocate fasting?  Because of science, or religion?  He seems to fill the book with both (watered-down forms of each), but NEITHER support his juice-fasting dogma, as far as I can tell.  \n \n Three times he wrote, "Supergreens is equal to 6 servings of vegetables."  Huh?  Equal how?  In calories?  In antioxidants?  In fiber?  In phytonutrients?  In KILOBYTES?  In toxins?  \n \n He leaves it to the reader to make of it what the reader likes.  \n \n \n If you want a summary of what science has to say about fasting, better look elsewhere.  If you want anything concerning religion, better fast and pray before reading this quack.  He\'s just telling us what his grandma told him what Benny Hinn told her what Jesus told him what the Father told Him.\n'

aS'\nI bought this before reading the reviews, which is unlike me.  Once I saw the experiences the other buyers had had, I was nervous, but convinced myself that it would be fine.  I run XP, so I downloaded the software from the Gravis site, installed everything, and tried a game.  The D pad wouldn\'t work, despite the fact that I had downloaded the XP software.  If this had been the only problem, I would have figured that I had just done something wrong, but the joysticks were awful!  Half the time, I would move the joystick up, to move forward, and when I released it my character kept going forward.  Not great when you\'re standing on the edge of a cliff.  I found it impossible to get any kind of control over my game characters, not nearly enough to even consider being able to use the gamepad for games.\n \n Another thing about the gamepad is that, although I tried it in the store, to get a feel for it, I decided rather quickly that, regardless of how it worked, it just wasn\'t right for my small hands (I\'m female, and have exceptionally small hands).  I can\'t call this a complaint, just a matter of personal preference.\n \n When I viewed the "Read Me" file on this thing, and came to the section about "Known Bugs", I about had a heart attack at all of the problems this thing is "known" to have!  After every single bug listed, they gave a completely lame, unsatisfactory "solution".  For instance, one bug said that games often take a moment to respond to input from the controller.  Their solution? "Please wait a moment after each button click, to give the game time to respond".  Erm, sure; I\'ll just politely ask 200 Orcs to stop attacking me while Aragorn takes a moment to respond, no problem.\n \n I\'m not by any means an extremely serious gamer with unrealistically high expectations for my equipment; I just like to play sometimes, and want moderately sufficient results.  This controller came nowhere near that, and I\'ll be returning it tomorrow morning, after only owning it for about 18 hours.\n'

aS'\nI have just five words of advice for all you Amazon shoppers: do not buy this book. I mean it. Even if you don\'t believe me when I tell you how bad it is, and you insist on reading it, don\'t buy it. Borrow it from a friend or take it out from the library (if you absolutely must). This drivel doesn\'t even deserve your time let alone your money or shelf space. Judging from this book alone, Candace Bushnell is a horrible author. I\'ve yet to read \'Sex and the City\', but I love the show. If that novel is anything like this trash, I\'ll have no choice other than to stay away. Not only is every character blonde, Bushnell must have run out of ideas because every character is either a model, an actor, a writer, or a business person. Oh, and they\'re all addicted to cocaine, like it\'s normal to be carrying around a vial of coke. It\'s sick, really.\n \n As you may or may not be aware, \'Four Blondes\' is not a novel about (as the title suggests) four blonde friends (much like \'Sex and the City\'). Rather, it\'s four short stories about four different blondes. The first two stories are complete wastes of time. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn\'t even bother with those two. Even if you\'ve already taken the time to take the book out from the library. Of course, if you\'ve taken the time to visit the library and pick this trash up, you\'ve obviously decided against heeding my advice anyway, in which case, you may as well go ahead and  continue to ignore me. The second two stories arn\'t much better than the first, but I found them to be the lesser of two (or in this case, four) evils.\n \n The first story is about an ex-model named Janey Wilcox. She\'s a manipulative sleaze who cares about no one except herself. She also loves using men for their summer homes in the Hamptons, and doesn\'t care if she dispises these men, she\'ll still sleep with them. Janey is shallow, vain, and wants to do "something" with her life (here\'s an idea, get a job you trashy, evil woman). She loves ruining other people\'s lives and then expects them to, not only care, but actually come running to her aid when she\'s managed to dig herself into a situation she could have avoided if she was a decent human being. She hates her sister, Patty, because Patty\'s successful, happy, and a good person. I liked Patty. Usually, arn\'t readers supposed to like the primary, rather than the secondary, characters?\n \n The second story is about Winnie and James Dieke. They\'re a married couple who never should have gotten married in the first place. You think Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson are a match made in I-can\'t-believe-how-unbelievably-stupid-spoiled-and-annoying-we-are Heaven? Well, then you\'ve never been introduced to the Diekes. They\'re both journalists and, basically, they hate each other. Winnie is over-controlling, and wants desperately to be successful and famous, whilst James has basically given up on life and is annoyingly frightened of everything. He\'s a wimp, a pushover, and an all around lazy guy. He\'s terrified that Winnie will leave him (oh, how will he go on without her telling him how to put on his socks!?), but she won\'t because she\'s still determined that being married to him with further her career. Oh, did I mention they have a son? Probably not, since they basically pay him no attention, and his name is never even mentioned in their story. What great people the Diekes are!\n \n The third story is about Princess Cecelia. She\'s a self-absorbed snob who acts horribly to everyone, even her husband, Hubert. She seems to think she\'s head and shoulders above everyone else in the world because she\'s managed to marry the Prince of Luxenstein. She\'s basically insane. No, seriously. She\'s completely paranoid and is convinced her family is trying to kill her. She treats her husband like scum, even though he does absolutely nothing wrong. She\'s jealous of every other woman who\'s ever been in Hubert\'s life, and is convinced he\'s having an affair. She relies on other people for, basically, everything. And, even when they\'re trying to help her, she\'s discustingly rude. She does whatever she wants, whenever she wants, and when she doesn\'t get her way she complains about it and acts like an idiotic snot.\n \n The last story is the shortest, which is unfortunate because it\'s the least offensive of the lot. It\'s about a journalist who refers to herself simply as "grasshopper". She writes for a magazine, answering women\'s questions about sex. She\'s been sent to England to compare the sex-lives of Londoners with those of New Yorkers. She basically meets a lot of different people, has different conversations with both men and women, and picks up a lot of different veiwpoints on different ideas and beliefs. This story isn\'t funny, but it\'s hilarious compared to the first three (in case you were thinking this entire book was going to be a "laughfest"). \n \n Well, I obviously don\'t recommend this book, as I\'ve made perfectly clear. If I had to (and by that, I mean, if I was forced at gunpoint, because there\'s no other way I\'d ever willfully open this garbage again) read it again, I think I\'d start from the end. That way, if I somehow died halfway through, I wouldn\'t have had to read those first two again. I\'m going to warn you all one more time: STAY AWAY!\n \n THE FINAL VERDICT: 10%\n'

aS'\nWhat intrigues me is the number of five-star reviewers who seem to think that folks like me who dislike this book are hopeless, heartless cynics who have obviously never been in love.  I might gently suggest that a lot of  these reviewers are confusing giddy teenage infatuation with the idea of  being in love to real, mature love.  Mature love is not about magically  finding your one "soulmate" (to use the currently fashionable  blather) among the six billion on this planet.  (We\'re supposed to give up  Santa and Cinderella at eight.)  Rather, it is about caring, willful  commitment to people we occasionally can\'t even stand.  If, as a number of  reviewers have suggested, this book represents deep insight into the  "true heart of a woman", the feminists must be beyond despair,  and there are going to be a lot of disappointed lives out there.\n \n What  escapes a lot of enthusiasts for this book is that the author is  essentially telling the poor drudges over at Iowa Writer\'s to forget their  MFA\'s; if you want to be a successful (as opposed to great or even good)  writer, get your MBA-marketing. Ironically (admittedly a distant concept to  this author), that is exactly the advice philistine Lon would give  Sensitive Poet Noah, while Allie sulks petulantly downstage right. Now,  that\'s cynicism!\n'

aS'\nThis book is psycho-babble at its worst. (Why five stars, then? Read on...) The king, for example, is "really" a penis, and therefore the whole game is "really" an attempt at castration, because both players attempt to mate the enemy king. Castling is protecting one\'s penis from the castrating father because it "hides away" the game\'s "penis". Riiiiiiiiight.\n \n The queen\'s power, on the other hand, shows the mother\'s female power, and players who tend to swap queens early are afraid of women. Well, either that, or they are stronger in queenless positions because they are better in positional endgames than in tactical ones. And what about languages where the piece is not called a "queen" at all, such as Arabic or Hungarian? No matter--the very fact that it\'s *powerful* is enough for it to symbolize the power of women. Again, Riiiiiiiiiight. \n \n Worse than such nonsense is Fine\'s buying of, apparently, every single tall tale of the "crazy chess player" kind and attributing the "real reasons" for the apocrypical story to deep-seated psychological problems. Hence Morphy\'s "fetishism" with women\'s shoes (never happened) or Alekhine\'s "throwing" a king across the room when he lost (ditto) "prove" their sexual masochism and/or sadism; etc., etc., etc. \n \n The most puzzling part of the book is where Fine attribues deep, hidden psychological causes for *specific moves* masters made--of course, "proving" them all deranged in some way or another (all except himself, that is). A blunder is never a bluner, but only a result of a deep-seated, subconscious "masochistic" desire to be punished (by that standard, I am the worst masochist in the world...) A move that makes many threats isn\'t just a (usually) good move, it shows the deep-seated "agression" of the player, while a quiet winning move shows his "sadism". And so on and so forth. \n \n This sort of thing would, perhaps, be understandable if the writer was ignorant about chess. After all, total ignorance of, say, politics or economics didn\'t stop psychoanalysts from "proving" what the "deep psychological reasons" for war or capitalism (or whatever) "really are". But Fine was a very strong player! He, of all people, should have known that chess masters do not think like that. Of course his excuse is the pychoanalyst\'s eternal excuse: you may not *think* you think like that, but that just proves you\'re "in denial" about the "deep subconscious roots" of your actions. On the other hand a total stranger, like Dr. Fine, from decades and continents away, can effortly tell us the "deep subconscious reasons" some master "really" made a certain move. How did Fine aquire this magical ability? From St. Freud, of course. For the third time: Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.\n \n In short, this books does, indeed, show us something about the psychology of the chess player. It shows us just how confused and laughable an obviously intelligent man, and a very strong chess player to boot--Dr. Fine himself--could become once he fell into the silly dogmatic nonsense of Fruedian psychonalaysis. \n \n I therefore recommend you go right out and get the book! You\'ll never find a better example of rip-roaringly unintentionally funny psycho-babble. No comedian had ever a parody of psychoanalysis to match what\'s inside this irredeemingly awful book. It is *so* bad, it\'s good! This is the "Plan Nine from Outer Space" of Psychology books.\n'

aS"\nI was going to enter a monastery. I had it all planned out. I was going to take a vow of poverty and devote the rest of my life to prayer, reflection, charity, and serving the Lord. However, as I was about to take the vows I found out that I would NOT be allowed to take my Night Breed Wolf T-Shirt into my new monastic life with me. I begged and pleaded for them to make this one exception but to no avail. It was a deal breaker. I now work at Popeyes, though I'm hoping to go back to school once my mom lets me have her old car.

aS'\nJournalist Weisberg here cashes in on the current disgust with George W. Bush by trying to make his disastrous presidency into a tragedy, largely through analogies with Henry V, Winston Churchill, and Woodrow Wilson.  Bush nevertheless remains a frat boy who is pushed up into power by the greed and malevolence of the Republican party.  That is the tragedy -- that a great nation could be hoodwinked into voting for someone not even qualified for local dog catcher. As such the story is a terrible farce.\n \n The only real contribution is a good assessment of the much over exaggerated role of Dick Cheney in the formulation of Bush policy.  Cheney remains an evil presence but hardly the power behind the throne.  Bush is stupid but not so stupid as to allow himself to be manipulated.  He above all wanted to exert his own will himself.  His relationship with his father is not at all unusual, except that his father was president.\n \n The book relies on half-baked psychological theories and borrowings from the Freud-Bullitt volume on the peculiar personality of Woodrow Wilson.  It is not particularly convincing or useful.  \n \n As we prepare to elect yet another president we might at least learn to beware.\n \n'

aS'\nI purchased this product in order to spice up my sex life (or \'nasty funtime\' as my wife and I call it).  Quite frankly this compact disc has ruined my entire life.  After letting this CD play overnight, I woke up to the surprise of the friggin century.  My nether regions are now nearly the length of a damn football field.  Yeah, thanks ALOT!  I can barely shoehorn myself into a pair of pants and when I finally do, I walk around with a TENTPOLE bulging out the front.  Talk about uncomfortable!  I got fired from my job because they claimed I was being "entirely inappropriate in the workplace."

aS'\nI have to admit that i have never laughed that hard after seeing a movie then i did when i saw this one. I was laughing out loud because this film reminded me of the crap my proffesors used to make the class watch on "the evil of america" and "taking down greed". Such comical propoganda devices that resembled those used in the 1950s, only instead of targeting communism they target american business. The lies in this film were so blatant that i felt like i was watching MSNBC or Fox. As a third generation cuban, my great grandmother was cubano, it was rather insulting to show cuba as this garden of eden for equality and freedom.But i eventually got over this because you cant let blatant lies and propoganda get you down otherwise the bullies in our culture like Mr. Moore win. If there is anyone that actually believes that Cuba has an admirable, free, health care system let me state some facts gathered from actuall cuban doctors and patients who managed to escape. \n \n -IF there is a complication with the fetus of a pregnant woman the government forces an abortion.\n -If a child dies soon after birth the doctor will not record it as ever having lived at all (remember when moore stated that cuba enjoys a lower infant mortality rate? well there you go. thats the reason.)\n -That UN survey that states cuba as having a better health care system than us is on the survey, however the UN does not investigate countrie\'s health care systems, they simply take down whatever the country decides to report. Hmmmm....why should we believe what a communist dictator has to say about his own country?\n -Smuggled pictures show dilapidated hospitals, patients who are dying of starvation, neglect, and infection. \n \n Those people that Moore shows in his film that have the high medical bills, you know the ones that are the helpless victims of our "disgusting, greed driven society". You will notice that all the people are middle class individuals with big screen tvs, 3 cars in the driveway, and an outstanding mortgage for a house that they cannot afford. Hmmmmm.....and im supposed to feel sorry for their utter stupidity and lack of regard for their own responsibility? Why is it that in this country people will pay $6 for a cup of coffee, and $50 for a videogame, but when it comes to their healthcare its simply "too expensive" and somehow the fault of "greedy businessmen". Maybe Moore should make a film about prioritization in america. About those people that throw their money away on material possessions but when their bills finally catch up with them they declare bankruptcy. It is trully a unique society we live in. their is such an utter disregard for responsibility and so many avenues and entitlement programs to cover your ass with.\n'

aS'\n...he\'s cute, knows how to bark in tune, and is quite the dancer - and he refuses to lip-sync.  After all, they call them "live performances" for a reason, don\'t they?\n \n If my last statement sounds ridiculous, it shouldn\'t.  The media has come a long way in the last few decades.  There was a time when a person or band really needed to work their way up to become successful, by performing in small clubs for chicken feed, hoping that one day a talent scout would recognize their talent and sign them to a recording deal.\n \n But as the great Bob Dylan once said, the times they are a changin\'.  The fact is that in this day and age, you don\'t need any talent whatsoever to become famous - how else to explain the ubiquity of the irrelevant Paris Hilton?  \n \n To prove my point, witness the phenomenon known as MTV, which placed the music video medium on a widespread scale.  Started in 1981, it began as an outlet for established acts, but soon came the emergence of disposible pop acts which greatly benefited from the visual exposure that MTV granted them - Milli Vanilli and Britney Spears are but two acts that would have gone nowhere without the network.\n \n Second, let\'s look at multifaceted entertainers of years past.  It\'s much easier to respect musical artists that cross over to acting (Elvis Presley, Cher, and Barbra Streisand are examples) - after all, they had the chops to make it in music and eventually went on to garner respect in acting roles.  However, when an actor decides to take a stab at music, it makes the person seem desperate for a buck.  The completely tone-deaf Don Johnson, Bruce Willis, and Eddie Murphy made ill-advised recording efforts, but got wise and quickly went back to what they do best.  However, there are some exceptions to this rule - Jennifer Lopez is without question a below-average vocalist, but miraculously managed to sell millions of albums.  She succeeded during a time where sex appeal was everything, and talent was not a necessity - which also explains the stunning success of lip-syncing flunkies like Spears.\n \n This brings me to Lindsay Lohan.  Once a clean-cut star of many a Disney film, upon reaching the age of 18, she has turned herself into a walking Girls Gone Wild show.  The success of Spears and Lopez clearly paved the way for Lohan to receive a record deal.  Because we all know that if you are attractive and famous for any reason at all, that must mean that you are talented enough to become a recording artist - or so we are to believe.\n \n Despite all this, I cast aside all preconceived notions I had before I listened to this album.  Now that I have, it\'s safe to assume that A & R people would have laughed hysterically at Lohan if she were an unknown - her debut album Speak is, in a word: abysmal.  Modern technology keeps her voice in tune, but it doesn\'t help the slick, lifeless arrangements or the incredibly insipid lyrics (of which I can\'t be bothered to print).  Given the minimal amount of effort spent on this release (including very few live instruments), Lohan might as well have phoned in all of her "contributions" to this recording.  The worst offender of all tracks here has to be "Rumors" ... pity poor Lohan, who can\'t deal with paparazzi following her every move.  Honey, if it\'s privacy you\'re looking for, you entered the wrong profession - leave Hollywood, become a coal miner, and I guarantee you that no one will ever bother you again.  Problem solved.\n \n In summary: Yet another actor who thinks she can sing, Lindsay Lohan put forth a very weak effort that isn\'t worth the disc it\'s printed on.  There are far more talented artists out there performing in hotel bars just to make ends meet - by not giving your support to hacks like Lohan, record labels will have to work harder to discover genuine, deserving talent.  Definitely pass on this release.\n \n \n'

aS'\nI wanted to like this game. I really did. I read the reviews beforehand and I looked at the screenshots. I ordered the game. \n \n I even read that this is from the same people who made the King\'s Field series--I love King\'s Field. \n \n I hate this game. \n \n Is it because the game is too difficult? No. That\'s a bunch of newb complaints I\'ve read. It has nothing to do with the difficulty of the game. I\'ve put in over 28 hours of gameplay into this game. I\'ve killed some archdemons and bosses in every world. I\'ve got some of the gear. I\'ve participated in the coop and I\'ve had my world invaded by shadows several times. \n \n No, I can say that I\'ve put the time and effort into this game to really see that I don\'t like it. I thought "Hey, maybe this will become more fun." No, I was wrong. \n \n Let me number some areas I think the developers got it wrong: \n \n 1. First and foremost they made this game completely unforgiving. What do I mean? Well, about halfway into the game I accidentally cast God\'s Wrath in the middle of the Nexus (the main area). I had just purchased the spell. Well it hit a vendor. A very important one that happens to store all of my gear. Guess what? There\'s no way to undo that. Now he just attacks me any time I get near him. Sure, I could kill him, but I would not be able to store my gear or retrieve my stored gear. You get to either A. Start your game completely over, or B. try to beat the game with the weight on your back. Either way this was an EXTREME annoyance to me. I already had about 18-20 hours invested when this happened and I basically got to watch all that effort go up in smoke. Would this game be more fun if this wasn\'t a problem? Sure. \n \n 2. There is not a lot of loot. The reward structure in this game is flawed. You\'ll go hours without finding anything you want to use, unless you can somehow decipher the wiki information out there and hunt down the treasure--if you can get to it. There are about 15 swords in the entire game. Oh, yeah, you can upgrade your weaponry if you feel like farming the stones. That\'s about all the variation you will get out of this game. \n \n 3. The coop system sucks. Plain and simple. It either won\'t load sometimes or you\'ll be baffled as to how it actually works. I don\'t want to study a manual or search google to play with my friends. \n \n 4. You\'ll farm endlessly to level your character. You\'ll probably mess your build up. You\'ll get to start over again to get the right build if you care anything about this game. I don\'t care, so I\'m definitely not starting over. My build was pretty good anyway. \n \n 5. Finally, you\'ll die. You\'ll die quite a bit. You\'ll die after spending a half an hour trying to get to a boss only to start over again. This, again, is part of the reward structure that is completely flawed. \n \n 6. You can only equip things up to half your total weight capacity. On top of that, you have to have the endurance necessary to have "equip capacity" outside of that. So not only can you not equip anything you want up to your total weight, but you have to invest in separate branches to do it. It\'s similar to the magic side of things, too. You have to level your intelligence for your mana or mp, and you have to level your magic for the magic power. Then there is also faith magic, which is a completely different set. On top of that you only get so many slots based on the level of your intelligence or faith (depending on which one you\'re using). It\'s completely retarded. \n \n Oh, well. It feels like a waste of 30 dollars and a lot of time.\n'

aS'\nDon\'t waste your money on this convoluted and unfriendly piece of overpriced junk. Spend less and get much more.\n \n I should also mention Apple\'s crappy return policy for items bought in their store -- 14 days. \n \n If you find out too slowly how lousy this item is, you are stuck with it. And don\'t give it as a gift at Xmas -- your recipients can\'t return it either. You have given them an expensive paperweight unless all the stars are in alignment for them, andthen they\'ll probably find it useless anyway.\n \n First, users need a very fast computer to make iPod touch work at all. It also needs a $50 a month home broadband connection (or a long, long visit to Starbucks) to download the absolutely required iTouch software before the object is more than a bad paperweight, and only if users meet all of those prerequisites, will they have the barest hope of seeing the choppy, vastly oversimplified and way, way too fast video instruction set, to get any music or apps. \n \n Of course, getting apps or new music from Apple means having a wifi connection, so users are stuck at home or at Starbucks to do that.\n \n With all those stars in alignment, users will soon realize how taken they are. Every "feature" and app is easily duplicated on cheaper, better equipment with screens you can see and read, headsets that don\'t sound tinny or fall out of your ears, and good apps that you don\'t have to pay for over and over.\n \n Obviously, a $300 netbook does everything a thousand times better and does far more than the $300 iPod Touch, at the cost of what, 8 ounces to pack around? What exactly are you doing in the library with your iPod? Typing your term paper? I think not.\n \n The very fact you can\'t print, save or offload anything you write or find on the Internet makes for a huge, unexplored mystery, another Apple black hole in product design, that should keep you from spending your hard earned dollars, euros, whatever. The fact you can\'t buy for love or money a decent cover to keep the glass from scratching should clinch that decision.\n \n But particular demerits for the iTunes software, which took an hour to download and set up, because it is pathetically slow, and if you ever figure it out -- I figure you devote 15 or 20 hours to it and you may start to get the hang of it because doesn\'t work as it seems it should or as its limited instructions indicate -- you\'ll find it lame because cutting and pasting to folders ranges from cumbersome to impossible. \n \n iPod also has vicious default settings that you won\'t know about or know to change in the set up in the absence of advance instructions -- defaults that can sync your music and pix out of existence before you can stop that from happening when charging up. Yet it somehow can\'t upload what you want to add unless you spend an hour (without the benefit of any instructions) trying to figure out the one and only permitted place for upload stuff to be to get it into iPod (cutting and pasting to iPod as with a thumbdrive is simply not permitted, nor is avoiding iTunes, so Apple can presumably keep track of what you are doing). \n \n While the iPod may be able to hold thousands of photos, don\'t really try loading them more than 2 or 3 at a time, particularly if they are large size; the iTunes software simply can\'t handle processing them.\n \n Forget about giving it to a kid for Xmas. Besides the impossibly stupid return policy, the only porn filters are on buying at the iTunes store. The kid can see what he wants on the Internet with no restrictions whatever. Also, unless you take a lot of cumbersome measures to turn off your credit card info, your kid can spend you into the poorhouse, no way to stop that. That being said, iPod is pretty useless without hundreds of dollars worth of apps and music being loaded into it, so you do the math on giving it to a kid.\n \n Forget about a quick juice up. Apple admits it takes 4 hours to fully recharge from zero (though only an hour to get to 80%); don\'t hold your breath it is that fast, certainly not unless it is plugged into a fast computer with a 2.0 USB or the wall. It took me 1:45 to get it charged to 65%, and though unused, was at under 20% the next day.\n \n Apple also claims its batteries will hold an 80% charge after 400 cycles; this is EPA milage to me. Figure on spending $79 plus postage and tax to replace the batteries every year, plus spending a bunch of time trying to offload whatever you don\'t want to lose, and then waiting to get it back. BTW: mine did not hold a charge for the promised time right out of the box.\n \n The stupidity of having buttons do multiple things -- but only if you hold them for the exact right amount of time to the nanosecond so they don\'t do something else -- is not exactly what I call user friendliness. Forget about typing your messages or searches: typing accuracy is awful because the on-screen keys are tiny, tiny, tiny.\n \n If you really need music that much, first try using your home stereo, that\'s why you bought it for many hundreds of dollars. It will sound 10,000 times better and fuller, and you can share it with your friends and family. Even your car stereos will sound better than iPod by far. If you must have music while on subways or while jogging, use a regular Walkman bought in any drug store for $30 and regular music disks and regular headphones; it sounds 50 times better than 128 mp3\'s that cut off much of the sound not to mention the fall out of your earbuds, for 10% of the price. \n \n At one time, we were all audiophiles who concentrated on the quality of the sound; mp3\'s are garbage compared to regular disks, which are garbage compared to vinyl, especially when the stereo itself has some decent components. Then listening is returns to being about music and not about electronic toys.\n \n Even so, a regular disk plays for 70 minutes; walk around with 3 disks and you are good for 3.5 hours, and quarter apiece batteries last for 10 hours, with no need to walk around with USB adapters and computers or $30 apiece AC socket adapters or any extra gadgets needed to charge it up (if you get 400 cycles before spending $79 plus to replace the iPod battery, that\'s still 20 cents a charge).\n \n But if you must have a lot of music, you can burn those same songs onto your own party disks as mp3\'s and get about 700 minutes worth on each one, using an mp3 Walkman that costs $60. Do you really need to have more than 12 hours of music in your hands at all times?\n \n Do you really have to watch TV or movies on a screen hardly bigger than your watch? Certainly not for $2 an episode from iTune stores, when current stuff reruns on network websites free, and older stuff is readily available on DVD, using a 10 inch cordless player that costs $80 that you can walk around with (and which will play those mp3\'s at least as well as iPod for no additional money)?\n \n Do you really need to have a $300 item and a $30 dock work and a $5 app for your alarm clock when you could get that for $20 at CVS? Do you really need an app tokeep a checkbook that comes with a paper register? Do you need a paid or Google app to keep track of your own anniversary?\n \n Do you really have to have access to some current books on a 4 inch screen for $10 a pop? What are those paperbacks still doing on your shelf?\n \n Don\'t waste your money on this overpriced, underfunctioning gadget. Save it for the music itself (go to a concert or two or three).\n'

aS"\nL. Ron Hubbard wrote 'Dianetics' while under the influence of amphetamines and alcohol, plus his usual three or four packs of filterless Kools per day. In the book itself, Hubbard recommends Benzedrine. If not for the pharmaceutical company that manufactured Benzedrine, and the distillery that made the Gin, plus a regular supply of mentholated cigarettes, which provided nicotine, we likely would not have had this masterpiece.\n"

aS"\nI jumped out of the shower and had to decide between my ripped up AC/DC concert shirt from 1974, or my Breakthrough wolf t-shirt.  These were the only two that didn't reek of BO, and I was going to the bar, so I had to look my best so of course I grabbed the wolf tee. \n \n So I'm in the bar, having a good time, and I had to pee like a race horse.  I go into the bathroom, and doing my business.  As I turn to walk out, I sneezed extremely loud. This scared the hell out of the guy washing his hands in front of me.  As he went to look at me, he saw my breakthrough wolf shirt, and actually thought he was being attacked by a real wolf! he immediately pulled out a pistol and shot me right in my chest. \n \n Me and the guy who shot me now joke about what happened, but I'm pretty sure that the designer of this t-shirt should make it a little less real looking as not to cause hunters or scared bar patrons to whip out rifles or pistols to disable the threat of the attacking wolf. \n \n \n \n"

Matter of fact, Fallout 3 is a better title than this crap-fest.  The only good thing to have ever come from this was when I brought it to the local game store and traded it for Fallout 3.\n \n The game starts when you're trapped in some castle.  YAWN, like that scenario has never been played out.  The game continues on to repeatedly slap the buyer in the face each time you kill a rat or some other enemy.  I don't get how this has made so many Top 10 lists, this game flat out blows.\n"

aS"\nAll the hundreds of thousands of wannabe writers out there (including yours truly) and THIS is what gets published.  Granted, it's a great premise, its just terrible writing and saddest of all (judging by the success of this series) no one can tell the difference.  But by all means if you want writing that tells instead of shows, ideas that don't develop any further than it takes to read in a chapter about the length of a visit to the toilet and characters as memorable and charismatic as the physical paper they are printed on, don't delay, this is the book you've been waiting for.\n \n On the other hand, it's only fair that I point out that I've seen the comic book version and it's perfectly suited for that medium, it works much better in that form.  \n \n I'm not here to bash the writer, her success or loyal fans, just offering a warning to anyone who might stumble across this review to reconsider before diving in.  Ms Hamilton is cackling all the way to the bank, I'm certain her writing has improved over the course of the series  and I certainly don't begrudge her success one iota.

aS"\nI identify most closely with traditional Republican values. I don't know what the hell is going on in the minds of the people running the Republican Party, though. They need to shut this superficial,  down (because you know the money used to make this book is directly from contributions) and get back to reality. What happened to content? Original, critical thought? Passion for upholding American ideals, which are deeper and more complicated than this buzz-word dropping, catch-phrase parroting fraud (Palin) can ever understand? This book is simply a regurgitation of the same vapid, smarmy drivel that we got in the campaign, but even more self-absorbed and pointless. The last election was truly an embarrassment, and I know Democrats are hoping that Palin is nominated to run for president in 2012. Didn't we learn anything last time? Unless Obama gets caught actually making casserole out of live Girl Scouts, he would win re-election in his sleep. It would be like playing chess against a fish. Or Sarah Palin. \n This book is yet another blow to the already blind, confused, derelict and hopelessly adrift Republican Party. The Party leaders (and all leaders) ought to be re-reading the Federalist Papers, Common Sense and the Constitution instead of wasting their time reading or supporting this garbage. Please, please, make her stop!\n"

aS'\nI was curious when I first heard that the GND were going to put out an exercise video, since Im into exercise, I would want to try it out.  Bleh, to that.  I wasnt expecting the reincarnation of Tami Lee Webb.  But I sure wasnt expecting camera shots and music that were based in soft core porn.  Not one of those girls has ever hit the gym seriously in their life, because their form showed all.  They all say "I have to do this this and that," but their lack of safe technique and their uncertainty in doing even a push-up gave their claim up.\n \n Some girls are naturally thin.  Lucky them.  Some arent.  I have to work to stay slim, and I hate it when you have naturally slim girls pretending they work hard for their body.  And truth be told....they are slender, and thats it.  They could use less aerobics and a heck of lot of muscle toning, because their thighs shouldnt be jiggling if they want to promote (Or is it pornmote) a fitness video.\n \n Kendra\'s was the worst, as the consensus showed.  But Bridgit was not far behind as when she had to do her mountain climbers, she did them with the worst body mechanics possible, and her timing was completely off.  All of their timing was off.  This is NOT a fitness video, or exercise video.  This is a novelty video for people who want to see three girls in non-exercise wear (the cleavage shots grew tiresome) doing soft porn type maneuvers all in the name of "fitness."\n \n I cant believe Im the only one to not like this.\n'

aS'\nI woke up today to someone knocking loudly on my front door, which pissed me off cause it was way too early for that noise. I answered it, seeing the mail carrier standing there very nervously. She handed me a white plastic package and described how something had told her to hand deliver this bag to me, that it was "too important to leave out in the mailbox." I could feel my face flush and warm sweat rise from my palms as I greedily tore into my morning surprise.\n \n And there it was: My Wolf Flag Tshirt. I was so overcome with emotion I didn\'t know what to do first - should I christen it? Salute it? What to do.. Of course I decided to immediately tear off my whiskey-stained wife beater and slap this bad boy on my back.\n \n I felt a wave of empowerment wash over me as I stared down at the shy mailwoman who could do nothing more than gasp at the spectacle before her. It was incredible. I would describe the feeling as being somewhat akin to banging three strippers in a jacuzzi full of hundred dollar bills and liquid ecstasy. Which I fully plan on doing now that I have this shirt.\n \n Needless to say, me and the mail bitch boned right there on my sidewalk, for the whole neighborhood to see, for hours. STOP being a pussy and order your own Wolf Flag Tshirt. If this shirt doesn\'t get you laid within 4 hours of wearing it you\'re probably an asthmatic or have downs syndrome.\n'

aS"\nI bought this air compressor to use for airbrushing.  I need 20-40 psi and less than 1 cfm.  This compressor will generate 100 psi.  Here is the funny part...  the instruction sheet says for break-in you should turn the regulator valve clockwise all the way and leave it open (no hose, etc) and run for 5 minutes before using.  Fair enough.  No regulator... no valve... the think runs 100 psi and just splills that out into what ever you hook up to it.  You would have to add a regulator to it.  The other joke... it was so incredibly loud it was louder than my 6 HP 60 gallon upright compressor in my garage!!!  Ran it in my basement with the doors and windows shut and my wife was concerned the neigbors Easter dinner would be unejoyable in their homes in the neibhorhood around the house.  The noise was incredible...  I would say equivalent to a Jet air craft taking off in close proximity in terms of decibles.  I have been exposed to two of Campbell Hausfeld's compressors... both were the worst pieces of engineering garbage I have ever seen.   No reflection on Amazon please.\n"

aS"\nI purchased a UFO-01 a while back and I must say, it had served me well.  I personally think that it wards off aliens, as it has not uttered a peep in the last thirty years.  A couple months ago, the 9-volt battery in my UFO-01 detector leaked lithium all over the device.  Imagine how disappointed I was!  Anyways, I figured that it was probably time for a new detector.  I noticed that Image SI had come out with an updated version of the UFO-01 for the same price, so I decided to upgrade.  My main concern in purchasing was the lack of Alien-prevention technology, which is standard in many comparable devices, in the UFO-02.  But as I learned in school, first is the worst and second is the best so I took the plunge.  Plus, it is only $150, a relative bargain as anyone who knows anything about alien detecting can tell you.\n \n Setup and installation was a breeze.  I put it up on my roof for optimal alien-detecting and promptly felt reassured that I could once again tell when aliens were finally coming to our fair planet.  However, the very first night, the built in LED started flashing and a loud, persistent beeping awoke my entire neighborhood.  I, of course, recognized that aliens were coming and grabbed my katana from under my pillow.  No aliens were going to anally probe me.  But after extensive searching around my entire town, disguised as a lamppost, I found no traces of aliens anywhere.\n \n I can only conclude that the UFO-02 must have sent out a false alarm.  I am fairly unhappy about this as my UFO-01 had never even once sounded a false alarm.  Also, my neighbors are fairly unhappy with me, even though I was simply acting in their best interests when I razed their houses in search of aliens.  I had viewed Image SI as a manufacturer of quality equipment but obviously that perception must be re-evaluated.  Additionally, I had to climb back onto my roof to turn off the device, and the battery ran out within three days.  Those 9V lithium batteries aren't cheap, you know, and Image SI doesn't even include one with the product.  I intend to write an angry letter to the company.\n"

aS"\nAusten's supposed satire of the gothic novel is tangled up with what would have been the finest fluff of effeminate fiction -- had anyone else written it.  Austen, however, cannot resist sinking her sharp little claws into  naivete, romance, and (of course, this IS Jane Austen) men.  I will say, it  is the only book of hers that I have ever been able to finish. No one  would want to be quite as stupid as poor Catherine, but we've all been  naive.  Personally, I envy Catherine the ability to be so pure and trusting  with the object of her affection -- as jaded and overeducated a modern  woman as I am, I find myself reading the story with no feeling so strong as  a wish that (after closely and cynically examining him) I could meet a man  with whom I felt free to admire his perfections and flaws as the finest in  the world!  (I'm sure there's one out there.)  I'm sure Miss Austen would  find this proof that I am as contemptibly stupid as Catherine, but when we  kill our inner innocent completely, then we have made life unworth living,  and I pity all the people with whom we live and work. The book would be  much better if it didn't dawdle with condemning feminine sweetness &amp;  innocence &amp; male behavior's apparently universal (to Austen)  unacceptability, particularly in tarring them all with the same brush.  It  would be far better if bereft of the perfunctorily &quot;happy ending&quot;  which is treated in such a way that love and marriage wind up reeking of as  much of Austen's contempt to at least the same degree as Mrs. Radcliffe's  literary crimes. If you want to see this story the way it should be, the  way it's funny, check out the movie (an episode of Masterpiece Theater).   If you want to slurp latte in a windowless cafe and paint your nails black,  buy the whole Jane Austen collection!\n"

aS'\nThere is little doubt now that David Husselshaft is a major force in the music business these days. I\'ve already been a fan for many years, but an amazing thing happened recently which I have to share. The doctor said my dog Cherish had only days to live. Desperate for any sign of recovery, I played this CD in the garage for him 24/7, and not only did my dog die, but so did 2 cats and all of my plants. My neighbor came down with a rare form of stomach virus, the one causes massive cramping and explosive diarrhea. Boy did I prove that doctor wrong! The song "Hot Shot City" is particularly good.\n'

aS'\nBart Simpson put it best "only a girl could make a movie with vampires and werewolves boring.." That describes "New Moon" perfectly.\n \n The first Twilight film was tolerable. Slow moving, a little flat, but tolerable. Instead of moving things to a new level, New Moon wallows in the same somber material that was in the first film. But this time, girls, there are boys with no shirts = werewolves! How exciting? No, not really -  especially when there is so much maudlin dialog spread throughout this film.\n \n I have to give credit to the marketing people and the producers. They managed to create something that can directly tap into the pre-teen, teen female movie-goer. Guys know, sensitivity is a hard thing to fake, but if you fake it well then you, just like this film,  will be real popular with the ladies. The romantic mythology of this age group is a very powerful thing and this film carefully harnesses that energy, generating massive ticket sales. \n \n But is the film deserving of such attention? No, its not well made, the acting is boring and bad and the movie is unintentially funny. Lets hope this fad dies a quick death.\n'

aS'\nTo comment on the tyranny of Levin, I took the liberty of quoting him.  Here goes...\n \n Levin says this about the Liberal:  He rejects the relativism that blurs the lines between good or bad, right or wrong, just and unjust, and means and ends. (3).\n Comment: I must have missed your offer of proof of this assertion.\n \n "As the word `liberal\' is, in its classical meaning, the opposite of authoritarianism, it is more accurate, therefore, to characterize the Modern Liberal as a Statist." (4)\n Comment:  In other words, invent a straw man term with no premise or foundation offered, in order to constantly knock down this straw man...the Statist. \n It would be like me declaring this of conservatives:  "Let\'s call them Clubists, as in those who\'d aspire to be approved by or could afford join a country club, where the only minorities are servers, or as in the case of Limbaugh, who uses words like clubs to make his point."\n \n According to Levin, the Liberal is "angry, resentful, petulant and jealous.  He is incapable of honest self-assessment and rejects the honest assessment of others... Therefore, he must destroy society, piece by piece." (15-16).\n Comment:  Again, I missed his proofs of this broad-brush description.  It would be like a Liberal asserting, "The Clubist is greedy, imperious, humorless, irresponsible and generally looks like the love child of Dick Morris and Ann Coulter."  No back-up data necessary.\n \n  "Hollywood...uses entertainment to besmirch civil society." (19-20).  \n Comment:  Again, broad strokes, no back up.\n \n But my favorite, in light of BP and Halliburton\'s criminal drilling on the cheap that threatens to destroy the Gulf of Mexico, "The Statist\'s heavy hand has gripped the oil industry for more than one hundred years.  The oil industry...has become, in essence, a quasi-state-run enterprise, because it cannot drill...without receiving government permission, complying with government regulations... When the Statist prevents oil companies from drilling news wells in...most coastal areas, he is driving down the supply..." (74)\n Comment:  don\'t I wish...\n \n "By 2008, GM and Chrysler were essentially broke, and Ford was on the brink." (80).\n \tComment:  Ford never claimed to be on the brink of anything, but Levin\'s logic is.\n \n P.S. Levin doesn\'t like tenure, but likes tradition, one of which is tenure.  Which is it?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n'

aS"\nPlease don't even bother watching the first 3 season's of this series because watching the 6th season is like watching a totally deferent show. Nothing is cohesive and if your an actual fan of the core 5 characters don't even bother because theirs hardly any interaction between them. I remember watching the pilot of this show and thinking it had some potential to be great especially with the whole relationship with Dan, Lucas, and Nathan. Six episodes into season 1 I was hooked, everything was so realistic fun and new. I actually found characters that I loved and rooted for and character developement was at all time high. Two seasons later I would never have thought I would stop watching, all the character developement that was built during season 2 & 3 was shot to hell with season 4. Characters & storylines turned OOC and god awful. I thought season 4 was the worse but I still had hope for the new seasons. HAHAH big mistake, season 6 has taken the cake and I have to say I blame the writing. I mean come on how many times do I have to watch Peyton near death, I seriously could care less how a totally unrealistic character can be thrown into life and death situations just to see her cry 85% of the season. And Dan, jesus can the guy die already, he has been poisened, hit by a car, tortured by a pschotic nanny (lmfao yes that actually did happen), oh and let me not forget he needs a heart transplant. He was close to getting one but nah a dog seemed to come across his new heart and got hungry and ate it, WTF! It's so sad that this show has come to a dog eating a friggen heart to entertain people. No wonder the ratings fell from a 3.3 to a 2.8. I say season 6 is just a cheap imatation of a daytime SOAP, really the two most annoying emo twin couple is having trouble with their pregnancy - SHOCKER! oh c'mon will the writers try to be a bit more creative. It's already been said that Lucas & Peyton is one of the worse/awkward couples together so get over it and stop trying to get people to feel sorry for them. I don't even want to get started on the useless side characters hogging up the screen. Season 6 is just awful and worse season to date, the creator should just jump off a cliff because his show is DEAD.\n"

People bring names of unknown posers like John Petrucci, Jason Becker, Michael Romeo and Al di Meola, but fact is they suck because I\'ve never heard of them (because they don\'t play their songs on TRL. That means they are a load of ass). The bass player is equally amazing, showing losers like Victor Wooten, Tony Levin, John Myung etc how to actually play the bass.

aS'\nI\'m not usually one to give in to the hype. But everyone keeps talking about this "tuscan milk" and how it\'s the new macarena. It\'s texas holdem, low carbs, and reality TV all rolled into one. But this is one fad that is sure to last. \n \n I bought my first gallon, and not being one for moderation, I ended up drinking the whole gallon one morning. I was just going to drink a glass before work, then be on my way. One glass turned into two. Two turned into a bigger glass. Next thing I know I was sprawled out on my living room floor next to the empty gallon. \n \n I stumbled up and made my way out the door, only to arrive at work and meet an angry boss. He said he was letting me go, and I was "no longer a part of the vision". I was angry. And very much dissapointed. I loaded my things into my car and drove away. \n \n On the way home, my car started sputtering. All the lights came on, and my engine fell out while going down the freeway. I pulled to the side of the road, and started walking. I certainly wasn\'t going to call a tow truck, I can\'t afford it now. \n \n I then got the bright idea to call my girlfriend. Upon answering, I could hear a man\'s voice in the background. She was out of breath, and certainly had just come back from a long jog. I asked if she would come and pick me up, and she said she was "indisposed at the moment". I then became more angry, and asked her why not. She promptly dumped me. \n \n With my belly still full of Tuscan Milk, I plodded on towards my home. I started pondering why she was leaving me, and entertained the thought that it must have something to do with that man in the background. Who was he? Why was he there? Then it dawned on me. The truth, as I had then thought, had arrived. \n \n It\'s that damn tuscan milk! I foolishly blamed the milk for my problems. I lost my job, my car broke, and my girlfriend left me. All in one morning! I thought the milk was the cause. \n \n Hours later, I arrived at my home. "Nice" I thought, as I spotted the 30 day notice. The thought of now getting kicked out my house kind of made me smile. At this point, nothing could get worse, right? It\'s not like a gang of ninjas is going to come in and kill my family or something. \n \n If you didn\'t catch the sarcasm in that last paragraph, a gang of ninjas did indeed come in and kill my family. Got em all. But still, I dont blame the milk now. \n \n You might ask, "why Jeremy? why are you so jovial?". The answer to that, my friends, is because I\'m days away from becoming a millionaire. This whole situation will be erased. With my millions, everything will change. \n \n Fired from my job? Now I don\'t need one. \n Car broke down? I\'ll buy a lexus instead. \n Kicked out my house? To heck with renting, I\'ll buy a new one. \n Family dead? I\'ll buy a new one. \n Girlfriend left?  You get the picture. \n \n All my problems are solved! \n \n A few days ago I recieved an email from the prince of Nigeria. I appears their government is collapsing. And they need to move 100 million dollars out of there, STAT. So they researched, searching the world for a top secret, financial mercernary to give the money to, and found me. They must have heard about my skills. So they contacted me. I get, as a commission, ten percent of the take. If you think about it, that\'s a pretty good deal for someone who is saving your country. \n \n I\'ve given them the neccessary banking information to the proper agents, and everything should be transferring soon. I will hang out in the park, where I now live, and wait for that phone call. Once I recieve the phone call, the money went through, and you are looking at a ten millionaire. I think I\'ll go purchase some new duds, and maybe head down to vegas and bet ten thousand a hand. I\'ll fly to miami and dig my toes in the sand, or jet off to Hawaii for some fun in the sun. \n \n I\'m here at the library surfing amazon, and wanted to order some milk. For some reason my ATM wouldn\'t go through, kept saying insufficient funds, even though there is money in there. Must be some mistake. I\'m off to the bank to ask them what\'s up, but first I thought I\'d tell you all about the milk that saved my life. \n \n RECOMMENDED A+++++++\n'

aS'\n0 of 69 people will find this review helpful.  To begin, I have listened to every Radiohead album.  I would call many of them masterpieces and even indulge in the Reggae Tribute to Radiohead.  But, this CD...it\'s self indulgent woo is me and made me realize that Thom Yorke\'s style served as a template for boredom in music.  I had just purchased a new stereo and thought a modern CD would be a good way to showcase the music.  I was wrong, like that $20.00 lottery ticket that loses same concept.  This is a band that you never hear anything negative about and any album they release will be praised to the heavens.  Good for them, but after buying every Radiohead cd thus far and just selling the majority of them later on..... 5 star reviews I\'m not falling for them anymore.  I think perhaps this music is so ahead of its time I just don\'t get it.  Upon listening the music drones and the lyrics sound like teen angst high school woe is me poetry.  Radiohead you are not taking my money anymore.  I will always listen to the Talking Heads song "Radiohead" and think wow this song inspired a band to rip me off and keep coming back for more.  Brilliant artwork, brilliant album title but there ain\'t no Leprachauns or Rainbows here.  No pot of gold either.  The sublimity of Radio head though is I could say its sad that people flock to each new release by positive reviews and not give other new artists a try but, thats not radioheads fault they sell the cd for any price on their website.  The purpose of this review is if you like artists like VNV Nation, Cocorosie, Antony and the Johnsons, Sparks, Pulp, Nico, Leonard Cohen, Nick Cave, Morrissey, T Rex...then go buy or try a different band.  Don\'t waste any of your money on Radiohead.  Go buy a $20.00 scratch off ticket instead then you might find yourself in a rainbow rather than this sewer of a CD.  Don\'t Buy it Now.  Don\'t even buy the mint used copy I have up for sale.  Save your money.\n'

aS'\nMy son talked me into reading these books with him, and we loved them.  \n When we went to see the new Harry Potter movie, scenes for it came on during the trailers. \n \n He recognized the story the second the preview started.  He was thrilled, and so was I.  What potential this unique and fun series had for a movie--or movies...I mean, they advertised that it was being brought to us by the people who make the Harry Potter movies.  \n \n The Potter movies stay so true to the book--taking care to absolutely keep things in the screenplay that are necessary to the plot line.  \n \n I wish I could say the same for this movie.\n   \n When it finally came out, we went to a movie theater in NJ that was right across the river from NYC.  \n We could see the Empire State building from the theater parking lot, and took it as a sign that the movie was going to rock.  We were so psyched to see it.  \n \n When we left the theater, I thought my son was going to cry, and I couldn\'t un-scrunch my eyebrows--huh?? I felt so bad for him, for me, for Rick Riordan...\n   \n We understand that it\'s impossible to make a movie exactly like a book-- but this was a travesty. \n Every important aspect of the story was by-passed for the sake of special effects.  \n \n It\'s almost as if the screenwriter had been given a verbal summary of what the book was about, and took it from there. So many important plot points were left out or down right changed to the point that it would be impossible to even think about a sequel. \n  \n It\'s such a shame.  These stories have the "book made to movie" potential of the Potter series, or dare I say, a kids "Lord of the Rings".  \n \n If someone with vision had just read the books, the money used to make it could have been so much better spent.  \n \n It could have been knocked out of the park, but, alas, the ball was dropped and we all lost.\n'

aS'\nI am an acquisitions officer for an artillery unit in the Russian Army. Since mafia hooligans stole all of our equipment to sell to Kyrgyzstani rebels, we have been looking for a low-cost alternative to the T-80 Main Battle Tank. After successful trials at a facility in Moscow, this so-called "Badonkadonk" was approved for use in the Chechen theatre. Initial reports were favorable, but then somebody noticed that the tank lacked a cannon, treads, and armor, and possessed the engine of an electric bicycle. It did, however, have an excellent audio system, but this failed to compensate for its disappointing 100% mortality rate. Recommended only for use against Lithuanians.\n'

aS"\nI don't know what kind of hair this trimmer is supposed to cut, but it don't cut mine.  You can stick it in your nose until the battery dies (which actually is not such a long time), and you won't cut as much hair as you could with a pair of scissors in 10 seconds.  There's just no comparison.  This trimmer makes a lot of noise and painfully tugs on hairs, but it's all sound and fury.  Nothing much happens.  So, I'd say that unless you have tremors or something, you'd be much better off with a $3-pair of manicure scissors.  Do the job in 10 seconds.\n"

aS"\nLike a good Faux News reporter, Ken Gormley hides under a facade of facts, but somehow fails after nine years of research to answer the basic questions, like what were Kenneth Starr's motives for going well beyond his charter and sending investigators into Arkansas to dig into Clinton's personal life.  How did Starr allow investigators to wire Linda Tripp in an effort to get to Monica Lewinsky, when Tripp's allegations had nothing to do with Starr's Whitewater investigation, but everything to do with a witch hunt?  Gormley seems to think that by failing to ask the tough questions, he can make it seem like he is not taking sides, but don't be fooled.  Look, if you are a Bill and Hilary Clinton-hater, you will love this book, but if you are looking for the facts and the truth, pass on this one.  Gormley has nothing for you.  Gormley should just crawl back under his rock, and leave publishing to journalists who know the truth when they see it.  This book is nothing more than an extension of the Starr Inquisition into the next decade.  Enough already.\n"

Has snarled EVERY sheet of glossy brochure paper I\'ve fed it! #2: Who wrote the software, a pinhead? If you remove a paper jam (see #1), or even do something as simple as replacing a cartridge, it signals "no paper fed" and then you have to print whatever it wanted like it or not, or fight with it by unplugging, turning off & on, turning pc off & back on, etc. etc. and it still doesn\'t always reset.

aS'\nCertain words from various sources have been quoted, describing Justin Cronin\'s The Passage as "gripping", "intense" and "epic". I guess The Passage is considered to be an epic, because it clocks in at close to 800 pages. But by the time I finished reading, I felt this was an epic fail of massive proportions, and unless another book comes along this year, The Passage will be my most disappointing and worst read book. The hype is not always correct, even when a well-known respected author supports a book in such a way where you must have it as soon as you can.\n \n The Passage begins in the not so distant future, around the year 2014. The first paragraph is somewhat poetic and confusing, where you have to read it a few times to digest it; much like the majority of this book: "Before she became the Girl from Nowhere- the One Who Walked In, the first and Last and Only, who lives a thousand years- she was just a little girl in Iowa, named Amy."\n \n Amy\'s mother, Jeanette, gave birth to Amy when she was only nineteen, impregnated by a married traveling salesman. Jeanette ends up becoming a prostitute. One night her latest John won\'t take no for an answer, and she kills him. Jeanette has no choice but to give up her six-year-old daughter and leaves Amy at a covenant. The nun who takes in Amy is a young black woman, Sister Lacey, who believes God sent Amy to her for a reason. Lacey has been having disturbing dreams. But this is nothing new since Lacey has been a little girl, she has always known, understood, because THE VOICE speaks to her. Lacey knows Amy will bring forth a new way of life on Earth. How does she know this? Because it\'s stated without any real reason given.\n \n Around the same time Amy is abandoned by her mother and thought of the second coming of who knows what by Sister Lacey, Special Agent Brad Wolgast and his partner have criss-crossed all over the Unites States to pick up a select group of inmates to be experimented on by the government. This has come about because Harvard professor, Jonas Lear, has gone into the wilds of the Bolivian jungle along with a group of scientist and grad students on behalf of the USMRIID (United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases). Less than a month in, Lear has grave news. Through emails with one of his Harvard associates, he tells about an attack by bloodthirsty bats, causing death and sickness in his group. He and the victims are eventually rescued by the US military. Wolgast figures out pretty quickly why twelve special inmates have been chosen. They are being infected purposely with the bat virus founded by Lear. But when Wolgast\'s boss orders him to pick up Amy for testing, that is when Wolgast knows something more sinister is at play.\n \n For some reason Amy is the key to this all. Again, no reason is given and should only be taken at face value. Wolgast will put his life in danger to save Amy. But by then it\'s too late. Wolgast and Amy are able to escape, but those twelve inmates have transformed into "virals", bloodthirsty, hiding in trees, almost zombie like creatures who crave blood. And from some mind hypnosis and hallucinations through dreams, they can control humans and are able to make their way out into the world.\n \n Wolgast and Amy hide in the mountains. From very limited newspaper reports, he reads about the downfall of civilization and how the virals are infecting and multiplying. Amy has changed. She can no longer stand sunlight and doesn\'t seem to age, but hasn\'t crossed over as a viral for some reason. Again, no explanation why. There is one last resort by the US government to stop the viral apocalypse. An atomic bomb is dropped.\n \n Ninety-two years after the virals have wreaked havoc on the Unites States, (there\'s no knowledge of how the other European countries have faired because all communication has ceased) the remaining humans, who were mainly children rounded up by the US military, have carved a life out for themselves. These closed off communities in the mid central United States have found a way to carry on. The virals only come out at night and attack, so the humans armed with their bow and arrows, and protective high protective fences, keep these creatures at bay. There is a select colony mentioned in the San Jacinto Mountains near California to show this perfectly. But lately everyone is on edge. Their source of electricity is running out and the virals are evolving. And then a young girl comes out of nowhere who some have dreamt of. She is Amy, the ageless, and the only one who can destroy the virals. The people of the First Colony must travel back to where it all began and bring Amy to the one who calls for her.\n \n The first section of The Passage will grab hold and not let up. Cronin sets into motion a tension filled tale that you assume will have you shaking in fear. Unfortunately, due to very long winded paragraphs and so much information being handed out, without any explanation, The Passage is more of a mind numbing vision quest with heavy, almost in your face religious and spiritual mentions. I was so bogged down with so much telling and not enough showing. The majority of the time I was very confused. Cronin doesn\'t give any plausible reasons, and we are just supposed to take it as fact and move on.\n \n Most of the characters appear, where we are privy to their backgrounds, much like a biography, and then they disappear, only to re-appear again and bring nothing more to the story. This happens way too often. I couldn\'t connect with anyone, not even Amy. I felt very much like an outsider as I read. The virals, that should be scary boogieman type creatures, were glazed over in such a way that when they barely come out from the shadows they are hiding in to cause shock and horror, were incredibly tame and dull if anything. \n \n The overuse of the two words, "I am" became beyond tedious. Talk about a mantra that will give you a headache. Perhaps the title should have been I Am instead of The Passage? Amy can hear the virals\' thoughts, as I am John, Dick, Harry... I am the former Walrus, goo goo ga joob. \n \n I wasn\'t gripped, amazed or enthralled in any way. I felt like I was reading one of those literary journals I used for research back in college. 300 pages could have been eliminated easily to make it a much tighter read. In essence, the idea of a new spin on a vampire apocalypse sounds perfect, but the way Cronin wrote it, he has missed the mark big time. The Passage will no doubt become a best seller and will prove that a very lacking book can become an overnight sensation based on amazing hype, the support of much respected industry types, and an expensive marketing and promotion plan from the publisher. \n \n Katiebabs\n'

aS"\nThis TV lacks a number of features.  The sound is really poor, using built-in speakers.  I called Samsung complaining about poor sound, they didn't like hearing it. Poor AVC...audio volume goes weak then strong and never the same strength when changing channels.  One reason for poor sound, Samsung says, is internal speakers face backward, so if you have TV up against wall, sound hits wall. If they know this, why don't they mount them forward...?     Owners instruction manual is absurdly poor.  Written on cheap paper, small draft-quality text, poor descriptions, and ridiculously inferior setup information.   Shame on Samsung.  (This set is made in Mexico.....that explains a lot ! ).  If you want good owner manuals, look to Panasonic, Visio, Toshiba, etc...but not Samsung...!  The Samsung remote control is cramped & limited...!

After two purchases of this box over the last few years, I'm once again in the market and looking for a better solution.

aS'\nTimeless works often suffer at the hands of translators. One thinks of the numerous and continuing attempts to render Dante\'s "Divina Commedia" (another early vernacular Italian masterpiece and contemporary to the justifiably obscure Tuscana Latte series) and the struggle with both terza rima and meaning. No so for Tuscan Whole Milk ("La tutta latte"). Few works are better left where they were found, their authors condemned and eventually flogged. This translation of the redredged third valume of the series was committed by Sir John Stilton, the inebriated English librettist for two of the earliest publicly-immolated operas by P.D.Q Bach, themselves loosely based, in part, on the Tuscan series and "Mechanicae Popularum": "Die Fliegende Kuhe" and "Das Zaubereuter", both banned before their opening nights sometime in the early 1760s. \n \n That Stilton translated the Tuscan series at all was no mere stroke of misfortune. He was a cousin of Leopold von Emmenthaler, present at the Great Flushing of the Florentine sewers in 1755. As recounted in his memoir "Besottene Reisen", returning to his rooms late one night from a drinking binge, Leopold fell into an open ditch which drained into the Arno, but had been clogged. He was saved from drowning in the filth by the floating obstruction created by a massive snarl of wig hair and old used manuscripts -- part of which would later be tragically identified as the only complete copy of "Tuscan." Inspired to further drink by the experience, Leopold vowed to champion the mysterious work. He passed it to Stilton in a stupor sometime in 1759. Though arrested, Leopold was never proscuted for the act and he fled to his native Limburg.\n \n Rarely misunderstood and best left un-retold, "Whole Milk" is the culminating volume of the Tuscan series, but can be read (if necessary) as a standalone work, as both Skim ("Scremato" or "Senza Grassi") and Two-Percent ("Cauto") are diatribes on celibacy and vegetables respectively.  A tale of love, betrayal, and gastrointestinal distress, it is in this infamous portion of the "work" that Contessa Bessi meets the cowherd Giovanni de Sargento (the cloaked "Count Grasso") and confronts him with the immortal question "Gotta de latte?" This dubiuosly romantic passage is considered by some scholars as the inspiration for later poetry (e.g. Wordsworth\'s "I Wandered Lonely as a Cow" (1804); Dickinson\'s "#255", (""Cow" is the thing with horns." (1867)), books ("Care of Dairy Cattle in Central Peru" (1843); Proust\'s "Du Cafe chez Vache" (1914)), and even movies (among them "Cud" (1963) with Paul Newman and Patricia Neal; "El Cud," (1961) with Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren; and "The Guns of Navorone" (1961) with Gregorgy Peck and Anthony Quinn).\n \n This Stilton translation of Tuscan Whole Milk remains one of the more curdling, if only because he manages to improve the flavor of the work to the point that more innocent readers might be unwittingly exposed to it. It is clear that Stilton spoke little Italian, certainly not the 14th century vernacular of the region, and had no concept of style and structure. It is not certain that he was even completely literate in English.\n \n One star for calcium.\n'

aS'\nI am certain that there were a few people in the audience of this show who thought, "I could get up on stage and do what he\'s doing  if I had a full orchestra behind me." Guess what? They were probably right. Poor Rufus. His voice is very limited. It lacks power, strength, and is quite thin. It\'s not an attractive voice. As much as he strains (and strain he does), he simply can\'t sing this collection of standards with the expressiveness they are entitled to. He lacks the emotional depth (his between song anecdotes reveal him to be shallow and charmless. One anecdote has to do with him meeting the man who was the drummer who played in the original Judy Garland concert. Rufus\' classy description of him: "he was old and smelly."). Whatever possessed him to go through with this mammoth vanity project? Perhaps the ghost of Judy Garland while she was on another pill and alcohol fueled lost weekend? I am amazed that anyone put up the money to produce this night of self-delusion and self-absorption. This is nothing but karaoke with an orchestra standing in place of the karaoke machine. \n Ok, Rufus, the bar heard you sing once already. Shut up, sit down, and let someone else get a chance at the microphone. Why do I keep coming to this bar on karaoke night? Boy, do I have too much time on my hands. Hey, there\'s a cutie over there; I think I\'ll go over and say, "hello." Wait a minute! Who\'s singing now? Rufus again?! That\'s it, I\'m outa here!\n'

aS'\nI bought this toy for my kid in the hopes of sending a better message than all of those superhero action figures and he just loves it! This day and age, kids are programmed by our government to think that everyone is out to destroy us and that they need heroes to come and save us all. They forget that there are everyday people out there who need a little compassion and understandng.\n \n I make my kids sit down every day for at least an hour and play with the Cat Lady. We talk about what has made her the way she is and we discuss different options of things we might do to help her. We get into conversations about what rle society plays in the creating of these people who seriously have issues and then we practice empathy role play by having our social services action figures come to her aid and get her the help she needs. It has created hours of educational fun for our entire family.\n \n I recommend also purchasing the Albino Bowler and the Obsessive Compulsive action figures as well. We have used a cardboard box and built a small Mental health center/Halfway house where we keep our action figures always getting the help they need from the little doctors and nurses who work there. \n \n This is a great product and I recommend it to anyone who wants to creep out their children and teach them a vaulable lesson about the differences in people all over the world.\n'

aS'\nBut if not, you\'ll be bored silly by this book. I know I was. I\'ve rarely stopped reading a book before reaching the end, but I was sooo close with this one. The only reason I kept reading was because of all the 5 star ratings I saw here. I thought, surely, it must get better. It has to! I was waiting for all the \'laugh out loud\' moments that everyone was talking about but they never appeared. My advice: if you\'re not laughing away midway through, abandon ship! It doesn\'t get any better. In fact it gets worse.\n \n To be honest, I tend to read more serious stuff. I\'ve read a couple really great \'chick lit\' books but this one really falls short.  I picked it up at the library  in search of a quick light read. I didn\'t find it such a quick read because I just couldn\'t get into it. And yes, it\'s light but really dull and well, for me anyway, boring.\n \n Where do I start with what I disliked about this book? The characters are flimsy caricatures -- completely unbelievable and they\'re all so irritatingly thick. The dialogue never really goes anywhere. Emma has this completely irritating habit of starting every other sentence with "er, uh, um...." Whatever laughs there are are so belaboured that they\'re just not funny anymore. For instance, the big scene where Jack spews all of Emma\'s secrets & her colleagues respond in shock to every single darned one goes on for some 4 pages (\'You\'re really a size  6?\' \'You have a  Barbie bedspread?\' \'You hate crochet?\' bla bla bla...) Boy, funny stuff. You already know what all of them are anyway, so there\'s just no sense of suspense or tension. And in general, you know what\'s going to happen ages before it does, so as I was reading I kept thinking \'oh come on, get on with it already!\' I found the writing style just plain flat and uninspiring. There\'s just no depth of any kind. Worst of all, the plot line is so contrived.  I completely get why Emma would think she was \'madly\' in love with Jack after just a couple dates but what\'s Jack\'s deal? Are we really supposed to believe that some multi-millionaire CEO would fall in love with this ditzy, dim junior employee who is easily what, 20 years his junior? Riiiight. And Jack\'s \'big secret\'? Now THAT made me laugh because it was just soo silly! And the sappy ending? Yuck!\n \n Sorry, I just could not recommend this one unless you were shipwrecked on an deserted island with absolutely positively nothing else to do and even then, maybe not. I truly am baffled by all the rave reviews here. It reads more like a teen novel than something for adults --  very, very, very sophmoric. Anyway, you get the point. I really didn\'t like it. \n \n I would, however, like to recommend 2 other chick lit books that surpass this one by miles. The Other Side of the  Story by Marian Keyes is an incredibly witty, smart, sparkly, genuine laugh-out-loud book. I couldn\'t  put it down and although it\'s long, I was disappointed when I was done because I wanted more. Girl\'s Poker Night by Jill Davis is another very funny, very bright book. Both of these books are everything I think this one hoped to be.\n'

aS"\nLooking for a spooky tale to curl up to this Halloween season?  Is there a glaring gap between your Stephen King and Anne Rice books on the shelf?  Here's the perfect horror novel to plug it with!\n \n A supernatural thriller to the core, the monster in this book will thrill and chill you! A demonic entity named Yahweh sets humanity up with the perfect trap: the Tree of Life. Knowing they'll eat the otherwise purposeless fruit, he slaps them with a generational curse that binds them to his malevolent will!  What follows is the most twisted tale of evil ever written! Yahweh, egotistical and ragingly jealous, uses those under his control to rape and pillage cultures that don't worship him.  Men, women and animals alike were slain in these bloodthirsty raids.  The only hope you had was being a virgin woman whom Yahweh encourages to be conquested [Deuteronomy 21:10-13], [Deuteronomy 20:13-16].\n \n If you have a hard time reading about cruel animal and human sacrifices, perverted sexual references and the murder and abuse of children I suggest not picking this up.  This is a true tale of horror and our villian is far from tactful!  However, Yahweh's not a transparent, homocidal manaic.  To be so would be far too predictable and I commend the author on his skillful character development.  What makes Yahweh so fiendish is that he commits his violent acts under the veneer of love! To fool humanity futher he sent down a hippy version of himself and later set that person up to die, quenching his bloodlust once again.  But, that's not where the horror ends!  I hate to give away the ending but it's far too devious to go unmentioned!  In the end his cult followers will be sucked  into an alternative dimension where they will toil and praise his ego to neverending extents.  Those who choose not to accept his conditional, unconditional love will find themselves in a sadistic torture pit of his making.\n \n What's really neat about this work of fiction is you don't even have to pay for it!  There's many fan bases out there that will happily provide you with a copy!\n"

aS'\nThe message Hollywood appears to be sending burgeoning cradle to\n grave twenty-something consumers in this crude, unintelligent, \n pathetic film is  "Go ahead! Be irresponsible! Show a complete and\n utter lack of common sense! Have no self-respect and get pregnant\n out of wedlock with the next drunken rube who comes along! Why? \n Because everybody loves babies!"\n \n This film is as offensive and unsettling as movies can get. There\'s\n absolutely no resonance to the film....no emotional core to help\n even justify the ludicrous relationship between these two \n characters and what transpires. The film\'s bottom line is \n sometimes (often?) white, middle class twenty-somethings get \n drunk, and babies are born....and sometimes (almost never?) \n the egg donor and the sperm donor end up staying together \n against all odds and the child is subsequently raised in a\n loving, healthy family environment. Needless to say, the\n f-bombs tossed around in the movie are beyond overkill, as \n are the adolescent antics of the male lead and his\n neanderthal roommates. Simply put, it\'s a horrible film.\n \n Still, the overwhelming sucess of this movie among young adults\n (I use the term "adults" loosely) and the film\'s beyond misguided\n attempt at providing a "heartwarming" love story under the guise\n of "comedy" holds up a very real mirror to the American cultural \n obsession with motherhood, pregnancy and childbirth on the one \n hand and Hollywood\'s stop-at-nothing attitude toward harnessing\n the basest aspects of American youth culture in order to make a\n buck. \n \n Katherine Heigl was right when she claimed the subject matter of\n Knocked Up was offensive to women. The title says it all. If only\n the beautiful and talented Ms. Heigl had steered clear of the movie\n altogether and directed her talents to a more worthy endeavor. I\'m\n sure she would be the first to agree.\n'

aS'\nThe only people on earth who are allowed to sparkle are as follows...\n \n 1) Drag Queens. A Drag Queen who does not emit sparkly fabulousness from the core of their being is a very sad thing and should be given a hug.\n \n 2) David Bowie. Need I say more?\n \n Someone needs to explain the why\'s and wherefore\'s of this whole "sparkly vampire" business to me. I really don\'t understand it at all. Going out in daylight... OK, Dracula could do it if he were well fed, so why not? But sparkles?\n \n Anyway on to the meat of this review... (which will likely get thoroughly ignored as there seems to be so much hype over this flick)\n \n As far as I can tell, Twilight has no plot. At all. There aren\'t any conflicts until the last 20 minutes or so. There isn\'t any drama. This is a vampire movie with no conflict among the main characters, only teen angst and Bella and Edward mooning over each other. The dialog between Edward and Bella would be better if it were done with semaphore flags. Thank goodness I had rifftrax going during those awkward silences. The really sad part is that neither of them really seems to have any real reason to angst over their boring lives. Nothing\'s really keeping them apart. The few glimpses of indistinguishable backup high schoolers didn\'t have anyone telling Bella what a horrible person she was and no one went to torment "the new girl." \n \n Anything that could be remotely called interesting would have been centered around Bella\'s sheriff dad and the "maulings" (read: vampire attacks) he\'s investigating. But the script instead goes to focus on Bella and Edward\'s wangsting.\n \n Anyone who thinks of Bella as a Mary Sue, I agree. This is perhaps the worst case of published marysueitis I have ever run across. Everyone likes her. She always gets her way. People drop everything to save her even if they have utterly no interest to do so. To make things worse, I found her to be a horrible character in general. There\'s one scene where one of the indistinguishable backup high schoolers is asking her out to the prom and she isn\'t paying the poor bit character the slightest whit of attention, preferring to gaze longingly at Edward in the distance. I\'m sorry, but that\'s just rude and under most circumstances would probably make someone a bit miffed. I don\'t care if the poor guy is a bit character, I\'d rather a small look at any of the their small dramas, because I could at least see that they had things going on in their lives from the tiny glimpses shown in the film.\n \n Speaking of small bit characters, the best one is some poor construction or engineering guy in a hard hat who finds himself hunted by the "OMG bad vampires." I\'ll give the redshirt credit, the shadowplay on the screen says that he gave them a fight and with an iota more depth, he would have fought them off. :) Go redshirt, go! I\'m told that scene was not in the books. It makes me lose all desire to ever read them.\n \n As seems to be the trend for this movie, the villains aren\'t developed at all. They are clearly "OMG EVOL!!!1!!" because they act like, well, normal vampires and because they see Bella as an interesting snack. Were they given more depth or a motive at all, I probably would have started to root for them. As it was, I was bored silly.\n \n Aesthetically speaking, the film wasn\'t terrible, although I could have done with less cool toned lighting. Kirsten Stewart is a pale deadpan enough without the camera making it even more obvious. Also, the soundtrack has a rather pretty piano piece in the middle, supposedly composed by Robert Pattinson. I hope he manages to get himself fired from the sequels before his entire career goes down the drain. He played a good Cedric in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. \n \n I wouldn\'t recommend Twilight to anyone. No amount of pretty camera work or tiny scene additions could save this movie from a script that would have been better used as toilet paper.\n'

aS'\nThis report is sadly deficient in important marketing data that makes the price of almost 500 quatloos seem a tad pricey. \n \n I was browsing Amazon.com one day at work instead of taking care of my overdue TPS reports, and I came across this important-looking document. Naturally, I ordered it with one-click and my secret phrase (chicks with goatees) and when it came (overnight with Amazon Prime) I plunged right in.\n \n I was deeply disappointed. There is nothing, NOTHING in here about the important statistic of splinters-per-square-centimeter-of-buttock. No pictures of Chinese buttocks, either, splinter-infested or not. No information on whether or not you can get the stains off the underside of the glazed wood (always an issue at our house) and the frequency of seat failures, in particular the split kind where the wood splits and LOOKS intact and you sit there but when you stand up, the blasted thing is pinching your buttocks and there you are, yelling for a bandaid, looking like a goob with a toilet seat stuck to your bum. Most unfortunate, and I expected this typical seat-fail-incident to be reported and given some statistical data. But, no.\n \n In addition, the report makes no mention if the toilet seat fits on your steering wheel and if so, how many Chinese find it convenient to drive with a toilet seat as a desk and Porta-Potty combo in their automobiles. Another regrettable oversight. \n \n I was considering buying this firm\'s report "All the Tea in China"   but I am worried it will be equally incomplete. Anyone know if it\'s any good?\n'

aS'\nThe spunky gal who first appeared on the scene as a simple-minded but endearing propaganda puppet for global corporate policy has now graduated to become the poster girl for those suffering from terminal stupidity.  The description of the book states that the book was ghostwritten (for SP fans - "ghostwritten" means she didn\'t write it herself - someone else wrote it for her).  In view of this fact, it\'s interesting to see that customer reviews praise the book by saying "oh now that I\'ve read the book, I know the real Sarah!"  Like George W. Bush, Sarah Palin is incapable of writing a book, and it\'s quite possible that, like George W. Bush, she has difficulty reading books. \n The conservative media (especially Fox News) has created a virtual Disneyland for those who can\'t handle reality to immerse themselves in.  And Sarah Palin is the princess in that Right Wing castle, who rose from humbleness to prominence by memorizing speeches written by her handlers from the RNC.  Why anyone would actually pay money to read this poorly written fiction is beyond belief.  If you really want to read a book by a prominent fascist, read Mein Kampf, it\'s well written and explains the mythos of the white master race much better than Sarah does.\n'

aS'\nI don\'t know where all of these people are getting their ratings from. Did we read the same book? The only possible reason this book could be a "best seller" is because of how notorious the case is. I have been following this case very closely, and am a huge true crime reader. I am also just an avid reader. This book was simply all of the information I had already read on the internet mashed together. Nothing new, no surprises no insight. I found it tedious to read page after page of law enforcement interviews verbatim--easily accessible from docstoc.com. There was little if any author input or insight and any insight or input given was delivered strangely and in a strange word order that had me re-reading sentences to make sure I understood. In addition to this the author\'s sentences were very clipped and short. There was no flow, no eloquence, no suspense. It is truly one of the worst books I\'ve read, and it is a shame because I so looked forward to it--in fact, I followed the case so closely, I COULD HAVE WRITTEN IT BETTER! I\'m sorry, but I feel like I wasted $7.00. In all fairness, perhaps my distaste for the book was in part due to my knowledge of the case. Maybe those who have no knowledge might enjoy the book. I wouldn\'t recommend it, but if you want the "cliff notes" to the case, this is the book for you.\n'

aS'\nWoe, thine gift of fire-less light! I am not one to fear the elements, but this "bi cycle light" has affected my spirit. How it works, I do not know. But it must be through mysticism and not fire, for it is not hot and nor does it flicker. Either it was formed through enchamberment of bright holy faeries or through sheer magics alone.\n \n It came to me through Amazonia, and I expect that such people of the dark jungles would find strange new manners to produce light. I have seen flash powders for making instant fires, and glass crystals that can change the color of fire and sunlight. But never have I seen light from nothingness. Amazonia must have powerful enchanters indeed.\n \n Moreso, this includes an enchanted reflector. It appears to be meant to be secured to some sort of pole, like a staff. I have secured it to my walking staff under the assumption that it protects me from evil lights, and reflects them as a harmless red glow. It\'s a fine idea to package both a light producer and a light consumer (shield), but nowhere is it written the form of light produced. I do hope that the enchantment is not soul-sucking and am currently testing it on a virgin\'s skin.\n'

aS'\nI got these socks as a gift. As it was, the gift was unexpected and strange. See, I hadn\'t ordered anything from Amazon and yet, when I got home, there was an Amazon box on my porch, addressed to me, yet oddly missing the normal gibberish stickers that come from the UPS or FedEx. In it was 6 pairs of socks--these socks. "Well, I can use some socks," I thought. So I took the socks and placed them, still wrapped, into my sock drawer.\n \n The next day, I was dressing and opened my sock drawer and found these new socks neatly folded and lined-up, which was odd. I also swear that I heard a faint rainstick and some distant tribal drumming as the drawer slid open. I attempted to wear other socks, however, mostly because I didn\'t want to wear white socks with my black shoes. But as I put the other socks on, they were all were somehow too tiny to fit onto my feet. Five times in a row this happened. I thought that I had shrunk everything in the dryer, so I gave up and put on these new Hanes cushioned crews.\n \n Immediately, I felt a sense of joy. It was strange, like the first time you kiss someone, or how you felt as a kid when waking up on Christmas morning. I kept wondering if it was the socks that made me feel that way, or if I was just somehow subconsciously triggered to reminisce.\n \n That day, in it\'s entirety, was wonderful. At least 50 people I had never spoken to before somehow knew my name. These were people on the street, even. At the coffee shop, the girl who normally had the demeanor of a disgruntled, middle-age cafeteria worker actually gave me free coffee and tried to flirt with me. Not just to flirt, but a stumbly sort of flirting that only comes about when desire has made you lose your grasp of language structure.\n \n At the university, I was excused from an upcoming midterm for a reason I don\'t even remember. I think it involved being "an attentive enough listener at lectures." At work, I was promoted to full-time salaried work with a bonus. However, in the parking lot, I thought my luck had turned on me as I discovered my car had been totaled by some rich guy in a Jaguar. But, no! The guy throws me into a taxi and has me pick out a new car for myself on the nearby auto row. So within 30 minutes I was the proud owner of a new Mercedes.\n \n These socks were great that first day, and I went to bed a happy but confused man. But very soon my luck had changed. The second day I again went to put on some socks and I immediately reached for a pair of these Hanes Classics. However, they ripped in the toes and heels. Five times in a row this happened until I was plumb out of new socks.\n \n In short, Hanes makes a fantastically magical sock, but I\'m rating this sock a 2 because the quality is pretty lousy. Also, my one day of greatness made me realize how horrible my life really is when I don\'t have magic socks to wear.\n'

aS'\nI know that in most natural disaster flicks they don\'t always get all of the technical details right, or they push the boundaries of reality a bit in order to tell a better story.  I liked "Volcano" and "Dante\'s Peak" despite their taking of artistic license.  They seemed to have consulted a scientist to at least learn the basics.  But this made-for-TV tripe goes beyond belief into the realm of laughable drivel.\n \n Indeed, the only redeeming quality of the movie is that it is SO ridiculously wrong that you start laughing in disbelief at its stupidity.\n \n Here are some of the technical wrongs:\n ~In each earthquake, for some reason the richter scale is a variable number that increases as the earthquake progresses and then decreases as the earthquake comes to an end.  In reality, the richter scale measures the total energy released through the entire event.  It can only be determined after the fact.\n ~If I remember my geology classes correctly, a 10.5 earthquake isn\'t possible.\n ~When a fault line "breaks" it does not create a sinkhole that follows train tracks around curves and only stops when it finally swallows the train that it has been chasing.  Get real.\n ~In the opening sequence, a cyclist outruns the earthquake waves.  No way anyone could ride a bike that fast.  The waves of an earthquake travel probably hundreds or thousands of miles an hour.  I don\'t know the exact number, but it\'s much faster than the 10 mph that a biker could go.\n ~Setting off a nuclear explosion wouldn\'t seal an earthquake fault.  It would create thousands more.\n \n Anyway, this is just a taste of the inaccuracies that were inserted solely for theatrical effect.  Unfortunately I was not on the edge of my seat out of suspense.  I lost all interest in the movie after the first 10 seconds, but kept watching because I was given extra credit in geology for writing an essay about how terrible the movie was.\n'

aS'\nI took my neighbor\'s kid to see this a while back. This movie pretty much ruined my night, and I will tell you how. We went to the theatre on a Friday night while I was baby-sitting (he was like 4 years old at the time by the way). It was a little warm out so I stopped and got us each a Big Gulp. That was my first mistake. This kid drank an entire Big Gulp of Mountain-Dew on the way to the theater (which I later realized contains a very high level of caffiene which he is not allowed to have). He said he didn\'t have to go to the bathroom before the movie, so I guess you can see where this is going. The theater itself was absolutely freezing, and this kid complained about it the entire time. The movie was a little boring and looked really fake. You could tell it wasn\'t real and was just a bunch of silly-puppets, but he was only 4 so I guess he bought it (I hope he doesn\'t really think fish can talk). Bla Bla Bla, the fish gets lost or whatever, lots of talking, then BAM! Shark Attack, and the kid screams and immediately proceeds to dive under the chairs, and come back up with his pants soaking wet. Great, kid. You said you didnt\' have to go BEFORE the movie, so now you decide to go DURING the movie. Later on the movie whipped this kid up into a caffiene frenzy, and he takes off his wind-breaker and starts whipping it around his head, and it hit this kid behind us and the zipper tagged him in the ear. The other kid\'s mom gave me a dirty look, so I tried to explain that my neighbor\'s kid wasn\'t very smart because he is only 4, but then I didn\'t want to start an argument so I held back my tongue. The worst part actually came when the movie was finally over and we went out to eat at McDonalds. I thought it would be cute to order the kid a fish sandwich since we just saw a movie about fishes. He took a couple of bites and asked why it tasted so bad, so I simply told him what it was. So then the kid, no joke, starts throwing-up all of his fries, and what I guess was a whole lot of mountain dew all over the chair and the floor. Then he gets seriously mad at me and does the now-vomit-covered-windbreaker frenzy. He was mad because he thought I was trying to get him to eat one of the fishes in the movie or whatever. He refused to clean it up or eat the rest of his sandwich so I just took him home. We tried to have a discussion about the difference between his sandwich in the movie, but he simply said "I hate you" (great argument, kid). In conclusion I would NOT reccomend this movie due to my awful experience with this bratty kid. Also, as I mentioned earlier it looks kind of fake. Later. \n \n howardtuttleman.com\n'

So lets consider the primary aspects of the movie:\n \n 1) Story line: An extremely weak plot. A snitch tells 2 bumbling cops about a narcotics drop off. The cops have a stake out (with just 2 guys), it goes foul, snitch dies. In comes a drug baron, a very very cheesy mexican dude with equally cheesy Mexican actors as side kicks. I live in LA, and I know mexican tough guys, these guys are the kinder garden variety. Seems the drug baron has lost a car. \n \n White guy (Bruce) has daughter\'s wedding, needs 50g\'s, decides to sell a rare baseball card. Card gets stolen by Stifler (from American pie... of Stifler\'s Mom fame). Stifler is in to parcour (Street jumping) and steals the baseball card, which he sells to the drug lord. Then comes the worst ever street jumping clip ever filmed. I mean if I had a retarded little brother, who had polio... probably he could jump better. \n \n Drug lord strikes a deal with the cops, get the car... get the baseball card back. Hmmm.. didnt know any NY cops who were soft enough to let a street hood call the shots. Anyway, these 2 evidently allow it. They trace the car.. By interrogating a 11 year old car jacker! JESUS! Car has been sold to a russian attorney. Honestly... NY lawyers make enough money to buy new cars (especially if living in a mansion with a swimming pool and detached garage as shown here), and any lawyer knows better than to deal in stolen goods and have his license revoked. /facepalm!\n \n The cops get the car, and surprisingly, there is a girl in the trunk, thumping away. Evidently she has been there 2 days. And no one noticed it, with all the dealings with the car...while stealing the car, changing the number plates (as you would expect car thieves to do) or while the car was being sold to the lawyer.\n \n Well, the cops find the girl. She is the ex-mistress of a Mexican drug baron, who our NY drug baron killed. She has a flash drive with the mexican baron\'s bank information. Passwords and cash amounts. (How convinient).\n She gives the 2 cops the slip, and leaves the flash drive (her only bargaining chip) behind. She is eventually caught by the NY drug baron.\n \n Insane twist : Stifler is being held for felony robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, Assault on a police officer. I believe that the bail for that would be around a couple of million dollars, but ... guess what... Bruce willis, who doesnt have 50 g\'s for his kid\'s wedding, has dough enough to bail him. BIG hole in the plot!\n Plan: stifler is going to go in to the NY drug baron\'s house (which everyone seems to know where it is...) and its a condemned house (by the looks of it). Stifler falls off the roof and dies (Lol). the cops are in a shoot out. The bad guys die. Black dude finds out from nanny cam his wife isnt cheating on him. Bruce\'s wife\'s 2nd husband pays for the wedding. The flash drive is forgotten.\n \n You are left with a wtf feeling.\n \n Take "Shutter Island" for example. It had one story to tell, which it did solidly. Genius, Scorsese style. Take "Cop Out", mindless plot made up by a writer who is obviously on some serious drugs. \n \n There is NOTHING which ties up. The story line is absolutely nonsense.\n There is some lame attempts at slapstick humor, but it is horribly presented.\n \n Acting: Bruce willis is a respected actor. He must have been seriously compromised (wine or women?) to take up this pathetic role. His team up with the black dude is really really ill matched. There is absolutely no on screen chemistry. \n \n There is a scene, where the black guy literally pouts and says "PUH LEEEEAAASSE... look at the nanny cam I put in my wife\'s bedroom to find out if she is cheating on me. I am too gutless to look, please look and tell me what happens." How lame is that.... \n \n The acting makes you disrespect Bruce Willis. Everyone else is pretty bad as well. Well, you get it, with such a plot, and such direction, no one can really look good.\n \n \n It is an utter waste of time. It is so much fail.. let alone paying to see it on a theatre, or paying to rent the DVD or pay per view.. Dont even download it for free. LAWL. Its total fail!\n \n Kaz, LA April 2010.\n'

aS'\nIf The Jackson 5 were little white-hippies, moved from Gary, Indiana down to Tulsa Oklahoma, had at least 2 less talented brothers, a lot less soul; a little less style, exchanged their Afros for some new goldy-locks, and were able to move from 1964 to 1997 then they might be Hanson.  I love Hanson!!!  Their raw talent to age ratio is absolutely undeniable in everyway.  Anyone who denounces "MMMBop" is an absolute liar.  1997 didn\'t have the greatest music to offer anyway!  One word: CREED was huge!  Okay, that was 3 words, but anyway...  Hanson had more soul in 1997 than most R&B artists.  Come on, Hanson owned the Spice Girls! and everyone who ever bought Bop magazine knows that\'s true.  Note: I\'ve never bought a Bop magazine, because its trash.  anyway...\n "Middle of Nowhere" is the best tasting bubble gum you\'ve almost ever had.  You know you\'re chewing bubble gum, you know what that is but you still want some, and you just can\'t get enough!!!  [Middle of Nowhere yielded 5 hits: "MMMBop", "Where\'s the Love", "I Will Come to You", "Weird", and "Thinking of You".]  If you weren\'t tapping your toe to "MMMBop" in 1997 then you were in a coma, or you just weren\'t tapping your toe in 1997.  It\'s true and I can prove it.  In closing Hanson could never be as bada>> as The Jackson 5, Creed isn\'t as bad as I made them out to be (but almost), and you should consider not being all high and mighty and buy Hanson\'s 1997 smash "MIDDLE OF NOWHERE;" if you play it in the middle of nowhere, no-one will make fun of you!  You might also land a girl who was about 12 or 13 in 1997 and now desperate for love at 24 or 25, and that in and of itself is worth the $7.99 that Amazon is currently charging...\n If you want the original and greatest child-star debut album off all-time then buy, "Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5" it blows 99% of most modern music off the map.  MJ was BAD every since he was 9!!!  Sorry Taylor Hanson, you should have learned to moonwalk.\n'

aS"\nMom proudly displays Dad in this urn in her assisted living apartment. \n \n After keeping Dad in a cardboard cylinder in the garage on the workbench near his tools, where he was most at home for a couple of years, Mom had to move to an assisted living facility. Since she talks to him every day, we had to prepare Dad for the move. He wasn't too happy about it, and he was pretty upset that we spent so much money for his new home, especially since the old one was free from the crematorium. He also wasn't too happy about being stuck in the same room with Mom all the time, because now he'd have to listen to her talking all day. \n \n When I told him the urn was pretty soundproof, he said ok. So I poured him in. He just fit, but I spilled a little of him on the workbench.He was ok with that. \n \n I guess we'll get the matching one for Mom when the time comes. Dad said to wait for a good sale, and be sure there's enough room for a phone so she won't nag him all day. \n \n Dad, it's been almost 5 years, and I miss you like it was yesterday. Mom doesn't miss you so much. To her, you're still there.\n"

aS'\nI read this book to find out what all the fuss was about. What followed was sour disappointment.  Storyline: No more sophisticated than those shortened bible stories for five-year olds.  Style: I have read microwave oven instructions with more literary flair.  Characterization: Flat, lifeless "characters", distinguishable only through phrases like "the boy", "the girl", or "the Englishman".  Tone: Preachy and patronizing to the point of being irritating.  Message: "Follow your dreams". How deep, and original. Further Peeve: Coelho encourages men to follow their dreams, while a woman\'s destiny is to await her man ("She never asked you to stay because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man" - p. 126). This is not taken out of context. Throughout the book, the whole "follow your dreams" motto is limited to male protagonists.   Don\'t be duped by the \'warm fuzzy feeling\' Coelho tries to leave you with. This book is as deep as a puddle.(...)\n'

aS'\nDo you feel your child is about to go into the world without all the "necessary" skills? Do you feel your loved one isn\'t adequately prepared to face life\'s most daunting challenges? Have you ever wondered what to do if you\'re stuck on a raising drawbridge? Are you so paranoid that you look for an escape to every situation? If you answered yes to any and/or all of these questions, then buy this book, NOW! This is your bible to every worst-case situation that life may throw at you, and more.\n \n But don\'t think this is strictly a humor book, and sure it may contain some of that, like how to escape from a costumed character/mascot, or you should escape a meeting by crawling under the table, but there\'s plenty of serious entries to go along. For example, if your elevator is plummeting, something I fear all the time, then you should lie flat on your stomach to distribute the force. They do go to experts for many of these entries, and although I wouldn\'t like to test any of them, I\'m sure they\'re pretty useful in the situation.\n \n It\'s the best-of the long-time series, sure to help with most any predicament you may find yourself in. And for further reference, this edition contains a CD with ever scenario, in full, complete with a few wallpapers and screensavers for good measure. Just be warned, every scenario is in Adobe Acrobat format, which I hate since it\'s such a difficult program to navigate.\n \n Overall, you can\'t go wrong in giving this as a gift to somebody, whether you\'re giving it to them for practical or enjoyment purposes. I highly recommend it for any rainy day, paranoid people, or anybody who just ever wondered what to do if... well, you get the point.\n'

aS'\nBen Kingsley, you really must have needed the money. Natasha Hentsridge was cast solely for that gorgeous body of hers; the producers knew that they had a ridiculously bad film on their hands and had to give the target  audience some reason not to complain. But complain I will, because I want  something resembling a real plot in my sci-fi; I want stimulation for more  than just my groin; I want my sense of plausibility to be stretched, not  tossed aside. This film is a mish-mash of retread effects, no thrills  whatsoever and way too many, "Oh, we just missed her again by seconds,  so let\'s chase her some more!" Wretched, simply wretched. Species,  since it\'s release, has been the movie by which I judge all others - for  awfulness. Whenever I see a truly terrible sci-fi movie, the first thought  that comes to mind is, "Well, it was better than Species."\n'

aS"\nTo keep it simple, To Kill a Mockingbird is more boring than watching people answer phones on PBS during pledge drives. The book's plot basically goes no where, and does not take any opportunities to make itself great. Instead, it takes the route of pure boredom, shallow characters, and an asinine plot that is so lame and so boring, a Lucky Charms commercial has a more compelling plot. I was barely able to keep myself awake during the time I read this book, and when I was able to stay awake, I was mostly spent that time imagining what else I could be doing with my time. God only knows how this book even is considered one of the greatest books ever, it's only a book of pure suckyness.\n WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The time is the 1930's, some years after The Great Depression. The story is told in a narrative by main character; Scout Finch; as she describes the racism and prejudice in her town somewhere in Alabama. Her father; Atticus Finch; is chosen to represent an African-American man accused of raping a girl named Violet Ewell. She talks about all of the experiences she, her brother Jem, and her father go through during this time in which racism was the norm and they receive much prejudice themselves. The main moral of the story is that if you kill a mockingbird, it's a sin and this book uses that moral to describe prejudice. How touching, too bad the book as a whole desecrates that moral with a horribly put together story. What ruins this book is the terrible dialogue, boring, shallow characters, a premise that goes no where, and much more. You can try and discredit my opinions all you want folks, you can't sway me. A lot of you already hate me for my review of the movie version, and basically looked at me as if I had just taken a leak on the Holy Grail (Hmm... maybe this explains why Bible verses were thrown at me). After my review of the movie I was basically called a racist, a swine, mentally ill, and unappreciative of art. I honestly laugh at how many people try to insult me and what they throw at me (Try and call me something I haven't already be referred to as). My opinion stays as it is, you can't hold it back. This book is worthless, asinine, a mockery of American literature, and completely boring... SO LET IT BE.\n THE GOOD: Some interesting moments.\n THE BAD: The rest of the book isn't interesting, the movie is better, but not by much.\n"

aS'\nWhile I understand the excitement over the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt, Available in Various Sizes , I must politely disagree with the furor over that particular garment.  At first I agreed with the hundreds of reviews of that other shirt. It arrived in the mail, I tried it on, and my cat fought me to the death, small woodland animals prostrated themselves at my feet and offered themselves as sacrifices, and human women ovulated at the sight of me.  I was an instant fan, and I knew I would never need another wolf shirt made by The Mountain company.\n \n Then I decided I wanted a t-shirt celebrating the life and times of the musician Howlin\' Wolf.  My dial-up internet connection was taking too long to load the pictures for this shirt so I ordered it based on the name alone.  When it arrived I was at first furious.  How dare The Mountain manufacture a shirt with a title that so closely resembles the name of such a legendary bluesman?  Their sheer audacity had me pondering a very sternly-worded letter to their Wolf Shirt Department, let me tell you.  But after I broke down and tried on this Howling Wolf T-shirt, all thoughts of letter-writing left me, and I never again wore the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt.  It now lies at the bottom of a mountain of detritus in my closet, never to see the light of day (or moonlight of night) again.\n \n The Howling Wolf T-shirt by The Mountain (100% Cotton Short Sleeve, fits Kids, Teens & Adults) is by far the superior t-shirt.  It is, however, not for the weak or for the superficial fan of The Mountain\'s wolf t-shirt line.  While the Three Wolf Moon shirt gives the viewer and wearer a sense of community, Howling Wolf T-shirt is for the true loner.  It\'s for the outcasts in our society, it\'s for every man or woman who ever looked into that vast night sky and realized nobody else was by their side to howl along with them.  The moment I donned this shirt, an overwhelming sense of angst gripped me like an existential vise.  I tore the sleeves off my jean jacket without thinking and I found myself outside the house wearing a red bandana.  My wife and children were nowhere to be found, as each time I wear this t-shirt I am transported to a world where I have no one to rely on but myself.\n \n I drove around for hours listening to the Smiths and the Cure, sobbing uncontrollably, but each tear drop was instantly absorbed by the shirt surrounding my torso and they seemed to make the image shine that much brighter.  I found myself in mountainous terrain with a few trees, very much like the biome depicted on the shirt itself.  Was it alpine?  Taiga?  I will never know for sure, but once I pulled over and stepped out of the car all thoughts of terrain descriptors vanished and I was drawn to a steep cliff overlooking a valley.  The moon shone high above, full and round, and I was suddenly aware that a change had taken me over.  I was faster, stronger, and my senses were more acute.  Don\'t believe the hype surrounding the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt when people claim it transformed them into wolves themselves.  I wore it and that never happened.  The Howling Wolf T-shirt, on the other hand, transmogrified me into canis lupus and I could no more stop myself from howling at that moon than I could grip a pencil (as a wolf I no longer had opposable thumbs).  \n \n Alone, I thought vaguely.  I am alone.  This world holds nothing and no one for me.  I shall forevermore walk the night on my own, killing to live.  Then, as if in answer, the moon vanished behind a cloud.  A soft voice spoke behind me.  "You shall never walk alone."  It all seems a bit like a Green Day lyric when I describe it here, but it was profound beyond mere words.  Standing before me was a woman cloaked in translucent white garments that revealed the feminine curves of her ample-bosomed frame.  She looked at me with benevolence and love, and suddenly I was aware that my moroseness and ennui had left me at last.  My soul flew free into the night above that valley.  We came together in an embrace for the ages, as the stars made cascading patterns, singing sweetly in voices no man will ever hear unless he wears this particular shirt, and even then perhaps only in size L.  Finally, in a moment of cosmic kismet, the moon goddess Luna whispered in my ear a lyric from Howlin\' Wolf himself:  "You know I called you darling to come back to the Wolf / But I\'ll be around, yes I\'ll be around / To see what you\'re puttin\' down".  \n \n With that, the light from both moon and stars winked out, and I slipped from consciousness.  I found myself lying on that rocky outcropping the next morning.  The Howling Wolf T-shirt was lying next to me along with the rest of my clothes.  Carefully avoiding any skin-to-skin contact with the garment, I carried it to the car and put it in the back seat.  Later, back at my house, I placed it safely in a Rubbermaid container (also available here on Amazon) and admired my taut frame in the mirror.  Gone were the sagging lines of middle age, the liver spots, and the fat deposits from years of abuse by eating Fudgicles and raw cookie dough when the wife was visiting her aunt in Philly.  Now I was muscular and lean, not unlike Iggy Pop if he were younger and had never ridden the white horse.  From that day on I became a better lover to my wife and a better father to my children.  I ran for City Selectman and won in a landslide despite that old conviction in the 1970s for public urination on an officer of the law.  I carry within me the spirit of the Lone Wolf, who understands that he does not need two other wolves at his side howling to the moon, but merely CHOOSES to be around others.  Anytime I need reminding of this inner strength, I don the Howling Wolf T-shirt by The Mountain and I am once again swept away on a river of sobbing, howling, the song "Alone Again (Naturally)" by Gilbert O\'Sullivan, and finally...redemption.  The Three Wolf Moon shirt may appeal to the baser instincts of a boy\'s character, but once you\'re ready to become a Man, it\'s time to step up and try the Howling Wolf T-shirt 100% Cotton Short Sleeve.\n \n Also, every time I wear it I find money on the ground.\n'

(ouch, right? but Bats? Even super nasty bats? How about going inside a tent? That work for ya?

aS'\nIf you are looking for a really expensive paperweight, or need to replace the brick in your solid gold commode, the Archos is the device for you. However, if you are looking for any amount of *functionality*, there are volumes of viable choices that cost much less and actually work, such as any Android-based phone.\n \n     I have all sorts of Archos accessories that I can use with multiple stereos, televisions and computers and I\'ve invested volumes of time now trying to get *any* combination of functionality that I can\'t get on something much cheaper -- like my netbook, or even my phone -- with little or no success. \n \n     To compare the application library that Archos provides [without using a hack another user has provided to access the Android Library] is like comparing the largest local mega-mall to a "7-11" corner store... assuming the corner store went bankrupt several years ago.\n \n     Alas, however, the hack only gets you past the software problems, and leaves you with the hardware and the firmware/operating system that Archos provides.

aS"\nSo is this the best selling movie of all time?  Well it is certainly the most over hyped and overrated movie of all time.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy good science fiction movies, but this is nothing more than typical Hollywood social commentary wrapped up in a long and boring melodrama with unrealistic and drawn out action scenes.  \n \n The social commentary becomes paramount to the movie and prevents this from being any more than a simplistic storyline with stereotypical characters who have unimaginative roles.  There are no suprises here.  No unexpected turns or twists.  It almost verges on satire.  The movie is supposed to be futuristic, with complex technology, and sophisticated technological operations on planet Pandora.  You would think it would require humans with specialized training sophistication as well; yet the guy running the robotic bulldozer is portrayed as some redneck in in his flannel shirt and baseball cap.  The evil money grubbing corporate guy is dressed in a present day shirt and tie, practicing his golf skills in the middle of the operations room.  T-shirts, present day military outfits, bows and arrows?  Futuristic?  Give us a break.\n"

aS'\n \n Michelle Malkin is a lady who makes her money by throwing dirt at politicians she considers left-wing.       That there is money to be made in this sort of endeavor, can be seen in the number of  right-wing screeds multiplying on bookshelves everywhere these days. \n \n Malkin\'s  latest , Culture of Corruption: Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks, and Cronies, joins another work, Unhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild .   As you might guess, there\'s nothing surprising in her latest work, as anyone familiar with her blogs,  and cable news appearances,  probably already knows.   The general tone of the books is  Malkinian rage.  Reading her latest, one is reminded of the sort of thing one hears  at the various town-hall meetings as well as the  tea-bag gatherings.  All shouting and nonsensical   accusations.   \n \n But what of  her accusations?    Has Mr Obama surrounded himself with tax cheats, crooks and cronies?  He hasn\'t of course, but in Michelle Malkin\'s case the matter is somewhat more complicated.  Her  brain doesn\'t operate in a  manner that corresponds to the real world.  This is somewhat peculiar since at one time she was a respected reporter for  the Seattle Times.    But that was then, and this is now.  Her brain is operating on a different frequency these days.   One that clearly ignores reality. \n \n Before getting into Malkin\'s main charges against the Obama administration, it\'s  interesting to note that Michelle Malkin is not just interested in the tax cheat-crook-crony angle, she has other objections.   For one thing, she says,  Obama\'s administration is made up of over-educated achievatrons.  Brainiacs.   People who are too smart.  People who aren\'t dumb.  (Worse yet, the children of members of the Obama administration send their kids of Georgetown Day School.   Georgetown Day School!  Where they will someday grow up to be valedictorians like their parents and join  still another leftist administration.)   This chills Malkin\'s blood.   Oh,  and don\'t forget the fact that according to the author,  the New York Times (that fish-wrap of a newspaper) owns Obama, or  perhaps it\'s vice-versa.  The author  doesn\'t really make it clear.\n \n The first chapter of the book smears Obama with all the charges listed above and more.  The remainder of the chapters, deals with a multitude of so-called scandals and vetting errors, the Obama administration has engaged in.  And it proceeds to  name, somewhat exhaustively a list of  individuals or institutions Michelle Malkin dislikes.  I mean she really dislikes them. \n \n Let\'s look at just a few of Malkin\'s dislikes.  Bill Richardson starts the list.  Richardson  was involved in an investigation  dealing with transportation contracts when he was Governor of  New Mexico.  Nothing was ever proved and ultimately the charges against him were dropped. But that\'s enough for Malkin to brand him a crook.   He never did anything wrong, but he\'s a crook nevertheless.  Next, let\'s look at Attorney General Eric Holder.  Mr Holder is a crime-coddler.  How do we know this?  Well, Eric Holder actually gave some advice to President Clinton recommending clemency in the case of some terrorists and as well as Marc Rich.  Note that Holder had no independent power to grant clemency, only the president can do that.  Still  Eric Holder is a, well, he\'s not a tax cheat, he\'s not a crony, maybe he\'s a crook. Malkin doesn\'t make that clear either.  Again,  the fact that Eric Holder has never ever been accused of a crime or found guilty of a crime  doesn\'t matter in Michelle Malkin\'s world.    \n \n Malkin\'s  list of phony charges goes on and on.  Even Mrs Obama is not spared.  Her offense:  Dressing in expensive clothing.   Also, she comes out of Chicago politics and she\'s  actually made money in the private and semi-public sector.  Which according to Michelle Malkin makes her some kind of well , take your pick--tax cheat, crook, crony?   I don\'t know.     \n \n There\'s no need to go down the list of  individuals and institutions Michelle Malkin hates.  But here are a few more.   Acorn is a bunch of shake-down artists.  The Services Employees International Union is a bunch of thugs.   Obama and his administration engage in a complex web of incompetence,  nepotism, influence peddling and self dealing.  They don\'t of course, but Michelle Malkin says they do and that\'s that.  \n \n Malkin makes a big deal about "tax cheats"  What\'s her definition of a tax cheat, you might ask?  Well, it\'s anyone what overlooks some element of the tax form and forgets to file some income or another.  Doesn\'t matter if it\'s an honest mistake, in Michelle Malkin\'s world there are no such things as honest mistakes.  The members of the Obama administration are constitutionally unable to make mistakes. When they file an erroneous tax return; they are TAX CHEATS.   The author likes to spend a lot of time discussing the case  of  Treasury Secretary Timothy  Geithner.  Geithner erred to the tune of  thirty or fourty thousand dollars in a couple of his tax returns, over a period of several years.   During this period he  paid all his other taxes.  But because he erred, (no, according to Michelle Malkin he didn\'t err, he CHEATED) he\'s therefor branded a monstrous tax cheat.\n \n And on and on its goes for about 290 pages or so.  \n \n If you\'re looking for proof that  Obama administration is a hotbed of tax cheats, crooks and thugs, you won\'t find it here, what you will find are a lot of  absurd, baseless,   partisan accusations, typical of what you can also find on Fox News and right-wing talk radio if you listen long enough.    \n \n So, if you hate the current administration as much as Malkin does, you might like this book.   Personally I disliked  it.  I found it boring, hate-filled, irrational and totally  predictable.  \n \n In other words, totally Malkinian.  \n \n .    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n'

aS'\nWhat staggering chain reaction of catastrophes allowed Ann Coulter to command a pencil? \n \n Clearly, an ego as huge and wantonly abrasive as hers belongs on daytime TV or talk radio.  She\'s ignorant, arrogant, and utterly vicious.  It hurts the conservatives to have someone like this on their side.\n \n This book should have been called "Who Needs Facts?"  There isn\'t a single fact in this book.  I repeat, NOT ONE SINGLE FACT.  Coming up with moderately clever ways of stretching any viewpoint other than her own into an artless caricature of itself, then smugly and ruthlessly slamming everyone who holds that viewpoint, is much more fun (and more satisfying) than doing research.  Coulter doesn\'t need facts.  After all, if anyone asks her why liberals are evil, she can just tell them it\'s because God said so.\n \n Let me assert that I am not a liberal only here to take potshots at a well-known conservative.  I am in the middle of the political road.  My view is that both extremes are usually wrong.  As an example, one of the guys in my workplace is the stereotypical angry young liberal: loud, opinionated, arrogant, abrasive, and ready to lay every problem in the civilized world at the feet of our current conservative President, GW Bush.  Obviously, there are things wrong out there that have nothing to do with President Bush, but you just can\'t tell this guy that.  As far as he\'s concerned, conservatives have ruined this country.\n \n Ann Coulter is the same thing only backwards.  She would have you believe all liberals are boorish, unshaven, tree-hugging hooligans. They bathe in the blood of murdered babies. They want everyone else to have to bathe in the blood of murdered babies. They only stop short of international terrorism because they lack the ability to organize.  You think I\'m exaggerating?  I\'m not.  Coulter says things about liberals that I wouldn\'t say about Nazis (a group which, incidentally, she compares liberals to in several places).  This book entwines ignorance, invective, and outright fabrication into a wretched, half-congealed mess, and then presents it as "the truth".  It\'s not her ignorance that offends me.  It\'s her smug sense of superiority I can\'t stand.  I read a lot: I\'ve got three large bookcases, all full, and this is the worst excuse for a book I can remember ever reading.  \n \n If you:\n are a hardcore conservative;\n are a hardcore Christian;\n are a fan of opinion in its most distilled and rarefied form;\n have a room-temperature IQ;\n \n then this is your book.  \n \n Everyone else, stay away.\n'

aS'\nThat review above mine is just some crap written by some poser with no taste. 50 Cent is just as good as all those old "musicians" that you cherish. People give him crap because he can\'t read or write muzak. Even more people give him crap because he can\'t read or write. I\'ve heard posers come out with garbage like "he merely exploits his image and shallow agenda because he wants money" and "his songs are retarded enough to allow him daily access to a wheelchair" etc etc etc. But I have one question for you. How many times have your precious "musicians" been shot? Everybody needs to remember that muzak quality (espeically in the case of rappers who the greatest musicians of them all) is based on the toughness. How many times has Beethoven been shot? Or Miles Davis? Or that poser with the violin? Exactly. Speaking of Beethoven, I don\'t know why people give him credit just because he made a bit of music when he was deaf. If you want a great musician with disabilities then go for 50 Cent.\n'

I am out of range (and the monitor doesn\'t let me forget it - which is good - but I don\'t feel like I should be out of range at this distance).  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this monitor to anyone, unless you enjoy not sleeping - not due to a baby crying, but rather your monitor beeping!\n'

aS'\nIt was a bright day in November. The frost shone golden in the morning sun as the newly settled snow hid the grey sparkle of the street.\n \n I had just climbed out of the shower, and was about to prepare breakfast when a knock came from my front door. I was greeted by a handful of letters and a flippant postal worker, asking me to sign for a parcel. I had fallen in love. The slim, smooth body, that awkward fitting cap that set off the perfect angles, the way I held no sway over their interest... It was literally love at first sight. The second and third were indulgences. Then came lust. I could barely contain myself as I grabbed them, and wrapped myself around them. Feeling their touch on my skin was almost instantly overpowering, I couldn\'t help but stare, my eyes were locked.\n The postal worker just stared, oblivious, but I knew I had met my love. The smooth ink flowed from the end of the pen, so effortlessly, so carefree and wild, as my lover screamed my name across the page. \n \n "Weirdo..." he grunted, and he snatched my love and retreated to his van. I was speechless, this idiot was about to ruin what had only just blossomed. Speechless... but not actionless. With one smooth motion, fuelled by adrenaline and love, I swung from my front porch onto the snow of my driveway, and flung myself at the intruder. I missed of course, my body in terrible shape from years of MMO abuse I fell metres short of my target, as he spun around at the sound and began to laugh.\n \n "Please... Don\'t do this to me" I croaked, "I can\'t live without her."\n \n He turned his back, climbed into the van, and drove away with my calligrapical angel. I cried, and my tears froze on the ground, as hard as my heart.\n \n Would recommend this product to a friend.\n'

aS'\nBill O\'Reilly joins the ranks of people like Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity with "Culture Warrior" in producing a work that huffs and puffs over an America that might only exist in their own minds and the minds of their devoted fans. So let\'s take "Culture Warrior" seriously for a moment and give O\'Reilly the benefit of the doubt: America is currently engaged in a cultrural "war" between conservatives and liberals for the soul of America and the battleground is largely the media (of which O\'Reilly is a part of) and anything else considered "popular culture." O\'Reilly uses various examples including the opinions of Hollywood figures such as Susan Sarandon, Jay Leno and his favorite, David Letterman. Apparently O\'Reilly believes these guys in conjunction with rap music, are a national threat. Like Pat Buchanan\'s "State Of Emergency," "Culture Warrior" feels more like the worries and observations of someone who is watching history pass by and would like to turn the clock back. O\'Reilly caters to the fears and worries of the conservative right by assuring them that we\'re the "good guys" and that Iraq is a just war(of course Mr. O\'Reilly has never served a day in combat or actually participated in an armed conflict). "Culture Warrior" is a surprisingly short book, composed of much material from "The O\'Reilly Factor" TV show, so it\'s not a very serious study to begin with, not because of the length, but because of the detail and quality of the content. At times O\'Reilly comes across as one of those old-fashioned preachers who see Satan everywhere and must cast him out of your living room and television set. He taps into typical conservative slogans by using terms like "we need to be warriors," "you gotta fight back," "Islamofascism." He rants and raves about the key points to outdo your "opponent" when debating a "Secular Progressive." Like Buchanan, O\'Reilly is shouting for an America that is quickly fading into the past, if it has not already faded. I would think a "Culture Warrior" would realize that cultures change, evolve, for better or worse, nothing stays the same forever. Like Ann Coulter, much of O\'Reilly\'s prose here caters more to the elites in America, with disturbing undertones in the descriptions of "lower class" America. Is Bill O\'Reilly really the most qualified voice to critique the merits of Hip Hop music? And haven\'t we had this same old tired argument since the days of Elvis? "Culture Warrior" is a requiem, a requiem bathed in self-dillusion about a "culture" that probably never existed to begin with. "Culture Warrior" will most likely fade with time as well, and in the future I imagine students will be reading Noam Chomsky to a higher degree than they ever will read Bill O\'Reilly.\n'

aS'\nHe always brought home milk on Friday.\n \n After a long hard week full of days he would burst through the door, his fatigue hidden behind a smile. There was an icy jug of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz in his right hand. With his left hand he would grip my waist - I was always cooking dinner - and press the cold frostiness of the jug against my arm as he kissed my cheek. I would jump, mostly to gratify him after a time, and smile lovingly at him. He was a good man, a wonderful husband who always brought the milk on Friday, Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.\n \n Then there was that Friday, the terrible Friday that would ruin every Friday for the rest of my life. The door opened, but there was no bouyant greeting - no cold jug against the back of my arm. There was no Tuscan Whole Milk in his right hand, nor his left. There came no kiss. I watched as he sat down in a kitchen chair to remove his shoes. He wore no fatigue, but also no smile. I didn\'t speak, but turned back to the beans I had been stirring. I stirred until most of their little shrivelled skins floated to the surface of the cloudy water. Something was wrong, but it was vague wrongness that no amount of hard thought could  give shape to.\n \n Over dinner that night I casually inserted,"What happened to the milk?"\n "Oh,"he smiled sheepishly, glancing aside,"I guess I forgot today."\n \n That was when I knew. He was tired of this life with me, tired of bringing home the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. He was probably shoveling funds into a secret bank account, looking at apartments in town, casting furtive glances at cashiers and secretaries and waitresses. That\'s when I knew it was over. Some time later he moved in with a cashier from the Food Mart down the street. And me? Well, I\'ve gone soy.\n'

aS'\nAs a history teacher at a high school full of unruly teenaged cretins, I am a firm believer of corporal punishment.

I mean, really, is it any big secret that politicians are lying to us?  Franken's real problem is that he paints just as broadly as those he attempts to indict.

It's a real shame, however, because he's a bright guy.  He has, unfortunately, been brainwashed by his long relationship with academia and the entertainment business.

Battery was not able to hold an acceptable charge after only a few months.\n \n Apple said it wasn\'t their problem, it was mine.  They said there was "liquid contact damage" even though they admitted the BUILT-IN "liquid contact damage indicator" showed NO liquid damage.  And no wonder, as there never was any "liquid contact." So either the (non-existent) liquid contact was at an acceptable level--or the "liquid contact indicator" would have detected it--or the indicator is faulty which would mean the product is faulty to begin with and it is no surprise then that the battery is faulty also, because Apple admits that even the fault indicator doesn\'t work!\n \n But anyway, Apple would not fix their faulty product.  No wonder they have had class action suits filed against them in the past.  Don\'t expect Apple to honor their warranty. If you buy one of these, you better buy the "Square Trade" warranty as protection against Apple not honoring their own warranty.\n \n And when they returned the iPod with the bad battery, the on/off button did not work correctly (it only works now if you push it repeatedly).

Granted, the Donk won\'t go head-to-head with a modern Abrams M1A2 fitted with the Urban Survival Kit upgrade, but in field tests against Russian-made T-72s, it performed admirably.

The addition of a German-designed Rheinmetall AG 120 mm smoothbore gun made it possible to take out adversaries from nearly 4000 meters away.\n \n Pros: The stock 6HP Tecumseh engine and drive train can be retrofitted fairly easily with an electric motor drive system powered by a surplus Russian-built Strontium-90 Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG).  That change out pushed the top speed of my Donk to over 92 MPH (though I did also have to upgrade to "R" speed rated all-season tires).

aS'\nI purchased this vacuum thinking I was replacing my old Panasonic model with the same newer model.....wrong.....this is the "commercial" model, and it is now a discontinued model......there were several differences.....when using the on-board tools, my old model allowed me to switch off the agitator with a foot pedal.....this commercial model does not have that good feature and clearly states in the manual...."CAUTION:  If tools are used, and vacuum cleaner is left in upright position, carpet damage could occur. (From the agitator!)  Agitator rotates when using tools, use care to ensure that nothing comes into contact with agitator. (No duh!)"......That is a SERIOUS design flaw, especially since it is a "commercial" model....I need to clean my blinds with the hand-held brush, and if the agitator cannot be shut off while allowing for a good suction feature for the tools, that\'s NO GOOD!....plus the suction over-all is worse than my older model (too bad my older model is discontinued, too)....plus, there is no bottom "cord hook" on the handle to wind the cord around, only a top hook...HOW cheap and inconvenient!....plus, the cord is an ugly "caution yellow" color, probably since it is a "commercial" model to make it look "industrial" (Not shown in photo!).....plus, when I tried to contact Panasonic\'s customer service, I had to make EIGHT calls, and got absolutely NO help from Panasonic!.....that was the straw that broke the camel\'s back.....I will not buy Panasonic again due to really bad customer service, and this model is not worth even a dime in my opinion.....I can\'t return it due to the high shipping and restocking fee from the seller, so I am now just going to keep my old Panasonic vacuum for a year or so more while I shop around.....I\'m not sure what I\'ll do with this hunk of junk that I just wasted $220.00 on....thank God I can vent in this review....save yourself the headache and money....avoid buying this poorly designed machine, in my opinion.\n'

aS"\nWell, its finally happened after all these years! The Wicked Witch of the West has finally met her match and her name is Rhoda Janzen whose cackling and theatrics throughout her narrative would make Dorothy jump right out of those ruby slippers. But if Oz is a little too old fashioned for your taste and you are into a more modern line of fiction then one only has to look at the recent book/movie Mean Girls to see the type of character traits that it appears that Janzen has. Truly, the only difference between this book and Mean Girls is that the characters are older and less well developed. Normally I don't waste my time reading catty literature about people obviously suffering from what appears to be narcissistic personality disorder but I had heard that this book was humorous. While there are a few funny tales most of the time Jansen does not delve into her family's intentions and motivations. Instead, she just skewers them leaving the characters flat and two dimensional...an easy way out often taken by novice and inexperienced writers. If Jansen learned about love as she claims then hers is definitely a twisted and warped idea of what constitutes true love and should probably be sharing a cell with the ghost of Squeaky Fromme. I do have a suggestion for Jansen's next attempt. It appears that Snarky B**** would be very fitting title.\n"

aS'\nHey kids!  If you\'re looking for music that\'s as satisfying and refreshing as a frozen sugar cube, deeper than a pool that\'s a foot deep and more exciting than watching paint dry, look no further than Rihanna\'s album, A Girl Like Me!  Listen to her wonderful studio-altered, digitally processed voice!  Gasp at the thought-provoking lyrics about needing to be rescued, falling in love and wanting to make love all night long!  Marvel at the synths, bleeps and squiggly sound effects that represent real reggae!  Forget no-good corporate hacks like Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Dennis Brown, Damian Marley, I Wayne and Sizzla, because Rihanna is the real deal and she wants you, boys!  What an astounding, brilliant, masterfully crafted work of perfection!  I like music, and I like Rihanna!  She\'s just as brilliant as amazing artists like Britney Spears, Good Charlotte and Simple Plan!  They should all tour together, how great would that be? ...\n \n ... Alright, enough already.  I can\'t keep this facade up any longer.  That was just me channeling one of those incredibly enthusiastic, overzealous Rihanna marks that think she\'s the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I wholeheartedly beg to differ.  While her work ethic is to be commended somewhat (second album in 8 or 9 months, but all she contributes is her weak vocals), A Girl Like Me is just another example of what\'s gone so horrible wrong with the music industry - the fact that labels still insist on pushing shallow disposable rubbish on everyone.  Essentially what is wrong with this album is presented in the first paragraph as backhanded compliments. \n \n On top of this, the fact that Rihanna is just another Beyonce wannabe (who herself is a Diana Ross wannabe) just makes matters worse - the overuse of melismas on this album is enough to drive any sane person mad.  But what makes this album a special type of awful is the fact that it is being marketed as reggae.  Now, there\'s some people that feel that modern reggae artists (such as Elephant Man, Sean Paul, even Matisyahu) don\'t hold a candle to the originators (like Marley and Tosh), but I have grown to enjoy it and recognize it as the evolution of the genre.  However, Rihanna is as close to reggae as a band like Fall Out Boy is to punk - in other words, the term reggae must be used VERY loosely.  An occasional Caribbean drum flourish and use of the dialect does not a reggae song make.  This is much closer to a hybrid of Beyonce and Britney Spears, right down to keeping the barely legal Rihanna\'s wardrobe budget low by having her prance around in only the skimpiest of outfits.  I can just imagine these comments from the director at one of her video shoots: "Hey, Rihanna, what are you doing out here in your underwear?  Didn\'t that outfit that we ordered arrive yet?  What\'s that?  The record label wouldn\'t front the money to cover the cost of the wardrobe?  Oh well, I guess we\'ll shoot anyway.  One thing is certain: The teenage boys will love this video.".\n \n In summary: A Girl Like Me is only worth checking out if you can\'t get enough of banal, vacuous pop garbage.  This is not reggae, ska, soca, etc.  It\'s bubblegum pop, and it\'s a style that has run its course and is becoming very irritating.  It\'s easy to market, and that\'s why MTV is playing the video every 10 minutes.  Speaking of the single, it\'s really just juvenile lyrics buttressed by the melody of Soft Cell\'s version of "Tainted Love" - nothing special at all.  The rest of the album is equally shallow pop with only a slight Caribbean influence, bookended by remixes of songs from Rihanna\'s last album.  I urge you to look past MTV and "hit music" stations to find better music, reggae or otherwise.\n'

aS'\nI can\'t believe I actually finished this book!  It gives even "chick lit" a bad name. The plot is preposterous.  But worse still is the fact that the "heroine"  is intellectually challenged and utterly neurotic.  The author presents her story as if this woman is to be admired, while she in fact behaves like a lovesick teenager and a horrible mother from beginning to end.  Are we to believe that she just lets her husband walk out of her life and doesn\'t bother to pursue him for seven years to obtain a divorce and child support.  (Isn\'t this passive child abuse?) \n \n Are we then to believe that she lets this scoundrel waltz back into her life and spend copious amounts of time with her fanatically protected ten-year old daughter, when for all she knows the husband has been abusing little girls around the world for years.  And, wouldn\'t said child be at least a tad resentful of the father who abandoned her? On a lesser issue, the heroine is supposed to be a sophisticated world traveller, but she is woefully ignorant about the locales she touts, not to mention little things like TSA rules.\n \n I could go on and on.  It scares me to think that there are women who actually can give this drivel five-star ratings.\n'

aS'\nFirst off the title of this review may be a little misleading. The handsom Cat Collage t-shirt isn\'t really greater than Success or happiness, because it actually provides both those things. I found this t-shirt in the alley behind the Kmart near my car (Now most people will say "your car can be anywhere, it moves dummy" not this car, shes just for sleeping, and pretending to wait for someone in). Why anyone would throw this shirt will always be a mystery. \n \n I haven\'t taken this shirt off since I found it. There are a few reasons for that. The first is that when I wear it I feel respected. When I walk down the street now large crowds of people seem to part, and they look at me with a kind of controlled fear. I believe this is because of the evil eye the tiger on the right gives anyone with fear or doubt in their hearts. The tiger on left gives stink-eyes to anyone who asks me if i\'m leaving my parking spot.\n \n The second reason i have yet to remove this shirt is because i have now set the fashion bar too high. I can\'t downgrade. Where am I going to find something as striking and visually pleasing to wear on my laundry day? The answer is nothing. Short of tatooing this image on my chest there is nothing earthly or celestial origin that can hold a candle to this beautiful fleece of black and blue. It is an understatement to say that this shirt is screen printed with a mixture of assertiveness and courage with a hint of playful instability. Its simply an eyegasm.\n \n The third reason i haven\'t taken this shirt off is because it was wet when i first put it on, and due to a sort of full-body trenchfoot i can no longer remove this shirt without a surgical procedure or i risk infection or possibly death.\n \n Saying that it is pleasing to the eye is simply an understatement. Look at it. It has 8 of the most beautifully drawn cats in the world on it. It has the type of cluttered variety that most t-shirt artist won\'t even attempt. Why wouldn\'t you want lions AND tigers on your shirt at the same time? Are you racist or something? I hope not. I think if 8 consenting cats want to get together on a t-shirt then by golly this is America and they should be allowed to. So big up to the BCC (Big Cat Collage T-shirt). If you want to do the most satisfying, enjoyable thing you have ever done in your life you will purchase this shirt. If you want to keep you job or make friends then go shop at the Gap or something.\n'

aS'\nThe Zenith Men\'s Defy Xtreme Tourbillon Titanium Chronograph Watch or Z.M.D.X.T.B.T.C.M. as I like to call it, is by far the most awesome watch. Chuck Norris riding into the Super Bowl on the back of Godzilla and round house kicking the crowd is no where near as awesome as this priceless poon magnet. When I was just moments from sending my $100k to some needy neo-hippie help group, I stumbled onto this gem. It was like the heavens opened and Jesus himself appeared with this same watch on. I mean how can you not follow Jesus when he\'s rocking a watch of this caliber. So I asked "What would Jesus do?" Jesus pimp smacked me and said "Forget those hippies, buy the watch!" I was like "HECK YEAH." I busted out my Discover card and bought this rocking piece of art. I mean its art but its also practical too. Like when I take my summer trips to the Marianas Trench, I have no more worries that I am going to miss Tea Time back on the yacht, because water ruined my watch again. It can withstand the immense pressures of the deep due to the wicked awesome titanium. Deep seas, cant beat this. Bullets cant beat this. Heck, I can deflect cruise missiles and the apocalypse. With a watch like this you don\'t need to tell time, you tell people what time it is.\n'

aS'\nI can not believe my eyes, or my ears.... The Jonas Brothers have once again blessed the world. These tunes are exactly what my melody starved soul needed. I was this close to losing my sanity and being unable to perform life\'s basic functions of walking, talking, and blinking. Thank heavens the release date was not pushed back. \n \n I am concerned that the stereo in Mom\'s 86 Yugo can do this CD justice. Maybe if I jerry rig the home speakers and put them in the back seat I can gain some respect. Some Jonas Brothers RESPECT... It is essential that the music be loud for me... It has to penetrate the court mandated padded helmet I must wear when I venture outdoors. It does not look stupid however, I hand drew little skulls all over it to give it the "cool factor". \n \n Just yesterday I personally experienced the Jonas Brothers touch two more lives. I was on my way to pick up Mom from the colon cleansing clinic when I was stopped at a red light. Of course I had my new Jonas Bros music at maximum level with the Yugo\'s windows completely lowered. The two girls in the car next to me were crying. I did not see them at first since my peripheral vision is not the best in my padded helmet. The Jonas Bros had not only awakened their deep seated emotions but it had also stimulated their dormant humor senses. They were laughing uncontrollably. I know it was the Jonas Bros because the crying laughing ladies were looking directly toward me in Mom\'s Yugo. I waved and winked but only generated more tears from these lovely ladies. \n \n I believe that a wise career move for the Jonas Bros would be a multi state penetentiary concert tour. Kind of like Johnny Cash did way back in the day. Their music would definetely help rehabilitate some of those thugs. Don\'t you worry about their safety... the Jonas Bros are some pretty tough looking dudes. Look at the CD cover. I would not want to meet them in a dark alley, even with my padded helmet on. I know in my heart that the Jonas Bros will be very popular among the prison system population. Like female entertainers at a bachelor party.... Everyone cheering them on and wishing for some alone time with them... to "talk about life".. \n \n I will need to order myself a Jonas Bros purity ring soon. I will wear it proudly just like my idols. Afterall, I have been getting a lot of female attention lately. (mostly stares). I need to send out a message. Back off you laughing flirtatious ladies. I am saving myself for someone special. \n \n Oh my lovely Jonas Brothers, Please don\'t make me wait this long again for another CD. Look for me at all your concerts. I will be the one in the padded helmet. The one with all the little skulls drawn on it.\n'

aS'\nTrue Blood Season 2\n \n Unless you truly enjoy the idea of wasting a moment of life, in a sedentary moment.  Do not buy this piece of crap.  If you\'re a Charlaine Harris fan, beware, both seasons bare little or no resemblance to the Book series.  They trash the Characters, and remove any semblance of an actual plot/story line.  \n I bought this and season one, sight unseen, which was a big mistake.  I recommend renting a copy or borrow one from a friend.  To determine if you actually like it, or buy a used copy as scratches can only enhance this trite idiocy.  All the stereotypes are here, in regard to southern white folk.  If you enjoy lame porn, you\'ll love this.  From Anna Pauquin\'s fake tits, to the town orgy, (oh yeah they went there) you\'ll really love this waste of an investment.  I bought it as a gift for a family member, they won\'t let me sell it off on e-bay. As it is a gift.\n The HBO people should have written their own lame storyline instead of trashing Charlaine Harris.  The script writers would make great senators or congressmen as they can\'t be bothered with actually reading either.  They certainly didn\'t read the book.  Queen Sophie is not only too tall, she is too old.  The characters do NOT match the book. No plot. A total absence of plot, yep totally gone.  Wall to wall brain farts. The best way to view this inane piece of work is through an alcohol induced trance.  Then it might actually look well done.  They took so many liberties with this, they should have created their own total mess, rather than hacking and butchering Charlaine Harris\'s work. \n Vampires would certainly not waste as much blood as they did for this photo shoot. There are other glaring errors as well, but too many to list here.  Oh and HBO dudes, three letters, CGI, an absolutely wonderful video concept used for special effects, check it out. Shaking the camera while someone is trying to dance poorly is not a special effect.  And lacks imagination.  Not to mention screwing up a Pagan Myth to the Nth degree.  They did get off on the totally black eye effect.  Ohhhh, Ahhhh A Hannibal Lectre rerun. Oh my.\n Gratuitous sex and violence, yep, don\'t get angry.  After all it is only HBO, So having no expectations is a must for entertainment viewing.  Just use the mantra...it\'s only HBO, it\'s only HBO...\n Never in my viewing history have I seen something done so damn bad. Actually I lie, I just remembered Captain Apache (1971) both are about as well done.\n Imagine a clueless idiot, looking at a Jackson Pollock and thinking..."Hey, I can improve on this...", so he puts paintballs up his butt and farts them out on a canvas (actually I believe this being done), then he thinks this is soooo visionary.  It\'s about as imaginative and innovative as the nut who peed in a jar and put a cross in it.  Way to recycle bodily fluids dude.  And yep, another dummy bought it.\n So, we have ugly people having orgies, (I\'m ugly so on the ugly front I know whereof I speak on ugly, never done the orgy thing so not so sure there but a definite yuck.), overdone redneck stereotypes, lame gags.  At least the first season did have a couple of decent laughs.  This series makes old porn movies, hey even new porn movies look positively genius.  As it was a gift I was obliged to sit and watch the whole insipid thing.  Of course given the other reviews here, I see some actually liked it. Ohhh....k. \n Buy this used or on sale if at all, and watch before you buy.  Oh, and all other Sookie fans, get over it.  Nothing we can do, But stick with the Books.\n  \n \n'

aS'\nI got this book as a gift when I was in a particularly bad place. At first I thought the life lessons were meant to be taken literally. I mean if you are falling out of a tree it only makes sense to "Hang In There". So when I read the one about loving something and setting it free I said "What the hell, my life sucks right now, lets give it a try". So I set my dog free and it ran into oncoming traffic. What does it mean if you love something, set it free, and a garbage truck turns it into meat salad? Keep your advice to yourself. RIP Bubbles.\n'

aS"\nI must tell you, I've read all the reviews and I doubted the healing qualities and powers of attraction the wolves tees actually command. That was until I ordered the Night Breed version.\n \n I arrived on a Thursday and to my surprise, the box was glowing! Slowly, I picked it up and a large electric surge shot right through my body. I must have been out for a few hours because Springer was on when I came to. \n \n Half dazed, I got up to get my last PBR and realized I was naked and covered with a thin layer of fur - the shirt burned into my skin and covering my upper torso. I was ashamed, I was dog-like - but I needed more PBR so I threw on a pair of jeans and headed to the Piggly Wiggly. \n \n Once there, thoughts of fresh meat and procreation ran constantly through my mind - IT JUST WOULDN'T STOP! 45 minutes later I was on my way downtown in the back of a police cruiser. Even though I don't remember a thing, I had evidently ransacked the frozen meat section, assaulted a bag boy's leg and sprayed on a diaper display in aisle nine. \n \n I don't regret buying the night breed shirt, because quite honestly, I've never felt SOOOOOOO alive! But if you're considering a purchase, just understand the raw power at your fingertips. Understood by few, wielded by even fewer - that's the power of Night Breed.\n \n By the way, I'll be on a upcoming broadcast of COPS - check me out. I'm the only guy on there who actually has a t-shirt on. The Night Breed Tee, that is. \n \n Gurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.\n"

aS'\nThe "Hardest Thing" I\'ve ever had to do Is listen to this cd, February 28, 2005\n Recently I had the misfortune to be given this cd by a homeless man. I was coming home from my job at the paper clip factory, where I put paper clips into cardboard boxes, when I passed a man asking for spare change. I apologized because I had none to give him, and he handed me this cd. "Take this," he said in his grizzled wino voice. "I tried to sell it to make money for food but no one would buy it."\n \n So I brought the disc home and put it into my cd player while I was cooking dinner for myself and my seventeen dogs and also my latest mistress, Angela Adams. I wish I had not put it in the cd player, because the music that came out was really not that good.\n \n Imagine if the Backstreet Boys met O-Town for dinner, and the four least talented decided to step into the alleyway beside the restaurant for a few minutes and began to scat. N\'Sync hears the racket and pops in to see if their services are needed, but Nick Lachey steps forward and says, "No, N\'Sync! Go away! We don\'t want any danceable beats or r&b flava in our music!" So Justin Timberlake and crew slink back into the empty garage next door to practice their moonwalks.\n \n Not only is the 98 Degrees music boring, but an examination of the cd itself reveals more issues.\n \n 1. The font which is used to write the words "And Rising" is an unfortunate choice. The components of the "d" in "and" are not joined as tightly as they might be, so the "d" looks like an "al." This changes the name of the album significantly.\n \n 2. The boys are standing in front of a wall of fire, which I assume is supposed to be a reference to their name, 98 Degrees, which is a warm temperature. However, any idiot knows that fire is much hotter than 98 Degrees. Human beings are hotter than 98 Degrees, usually by about .6 degrees, and they BURN when put into fire. In fact, 98 Degrees the temperature is not that hot, just like 98 Degrees the performing group.\n \n 3. Several of the members appear to have gotten tattoos of the band\'s name on their arms. How lame is that? Can you imagine if people in all bands did that? I bet Emma Bunton would feel really lame right now, what with the Spice Girls having broken up and become completely irrelevant to pop culture. What\'s that? 98 Degrees is no more? No one buys their music? Nick Lachey is best known as Mr. Jessica Simpson? Ha ha! Bet you\'re glad you got that tattoo now, sucker!\n \n I recommend you not buy this cd. Buy anything else instead. I hear Britney Spears is genius.\n'

aS'\nSeriously?? People, Suzanne Collins is stealing ideas from different books and movies and piecing them together, creating "something completely new." Come on. When I read this book, the only thing I could think was, "Hmm, where have I seen THIS before? OH YEAH, "Battle Royale" by Koushun Takami, "The Long Walk" by Steven King, "Lord of the Flies" by William Golding, the movie The Condemned, et cetera." This is plagiarism at its worst, I mean this book has been written a thousand times, and she didn\'t even try to change any circumstances.\n \n ...And now she is being recognized as inspirational, bringing a "completely new concept" of kids killing kids?? IT\'S BEEN DONE! It disgusts me that no one has sued her for this second-rate version of amazing literature. Also, if she\'s going to completely steal their story lines, she could at least do it well; Her writing is terrible.\n \n Not only that, but she\'s using a textbook example of a dystopian society. Like, there\'s not a thing that makes this society new or different. It\'s all so cliche! Can\'t she think of a single new concept? I mean, putting things in the blender isn\'t a skill.\n \n Well, that pretty much ends my rant. Please, if you\'re going to buy something, buy an original! Try Battle Royale, that\'s a personal favorite of mine, but whatever you do, don\'t buy this unoriginal cra p.\n \n Congratulations, Suzanne! You\'ve just proven that idiots without brains in their heads can be successful too!\n'

aS'\n...if you\'re an aspiring writer in need of a primer that gives never-ending examples of what NOT TO DO.\n \n I\'m working on a teen fantasy novel of my own, and Meyers\' Twilight series never fails to remind me of the things I want to completely avoid in my own writing.  Let\'s consult the list, shall we?\n \n 1) THE BORING SUE HERIONE.  You may have heard of the Mary Sue, the perfect female protagonist who can do no wrong, who has unnatural beauty, who is beloved by all; Bella isn\'t quite a Mary Sue.  She\'s described (by herself, at least) as plain and is endlessly clumsy (though her clumsiness is so contrived that it seems like a magical Sue ability, practically).  She also has no interests, hobbies, or anything that she excels at in particular.  Despite these flaws, Bella nevertheless ends up a Sue because everyone loves her for reasons that defy explanation or logic.  Even when she is behaving in a selfish, whiny, and intolerable way, Bella is never called out for her behavior.  The only character who ever seems disgusted by Bella is Jessica, but since Jessica is written as a shrew anyway, we\'re clearly not meant to put much stock in her opinion. \n \n 2) FATED TRUE LOVE.  In my world, Fated True Love isn\'t romantic, it\'s lazy.  It says "hey, instead of working out why these characters are attracted to each other and showing how their relationship develops, I\'m gonna just put it in the hands of FATE and have them fall in love for no reason whatsoever!"  Edward loves Bella because she smells good, which means Edward loves Bella like I love freshly baked bread.  Bella loves Edward because he\'s beautiful.  God-like.  So beautiful...really BEAUTIFUL, in case you missed it in all the numerous descriptive reminders.  But really, why do they love each other?  I have no idea.  Shakespeare was all too aware of the ridiculousness of star-crossed love, which is why he was smart and killed his teenaged lovers off.  But Bella and Edward\'s happiness hinges entirely on their togetherness.  What a strong, solid message to send to the young women of the world: happiness isn\'t something you create for yourself, oh no, it\'s something you can ONLY find in a beautiful, immortal man.  Bella\'s slow recognition of Jacob as a potential suitor was far more interesting and realistic, and it was teeth-gnashingly disappointing to see Bella repeatedly insist to herself that no one would ever do it for her again but Edward.\n \n 3) THE ZERO-HOUR PLOT.  Nothing much happens in Meyers\' books, aside from Bella\'s enthrallment/suffering over Edward.  In the last few chapters, Meyers will attempt to inject some kind of conflict into the narrative, either in the form of James, Victoria, and Laurent ("Twilight") or the Volturi ("New Moon").  It\'s difficult to get invested in this conflict at the last minute, and again feels like a lazy, tacked-on, "oh right, I am writing a book, maybe something should happen!" move from the author. \n \n Of course, as someone who hopes to be successful at writing teen fantasy, it\'s depressing to know that all I would need to do to achieve this success is construct a BORING SUE HEROINE, a FATED TRUE LOVE, and a ZERO HOUR PLOT.  \n \n Or maybe it\'s not depressing...maybe it\'s an incredible relief!  After all, coming up with those three things shouldn\'t be too hard.  If a lazy writer like Meyers can do it, anyone can! \n \n For readers looking for good, solid teen-level fantasy featuring interesting heroines, more complex and realistic portrayals of love, and truly gripping plot, I recommend Diana Wynne Jones and Libba Bray.\n'

aS"\nI bought this helmet to use for a second rider on my motorcycle. It's only good for that if you don't like your rider. It is not very well made, it runs small and the shell feels like it would crack if you dropped it. Didn't give me a whole lot of confidence that it would protect someones head in an accident. But considering the price, I guess you really can't expect to much. \n I would only recommend you use this helmet if you are riding a scooter or moped that doesn't get up to highway speeds.\n"

Arena rock used to be more monster truck, but now my kid brother\'s up on the stage, waving his snotrag above the greasy crowd like it\'s an extension of his "aura." \n \n I remember when these Brian Eno Juniors were just innocent leeches. On "The Resistance," these dime-store divas are all too happy to concede. And the one attempt at humor, "United States of Uranus," ends up merely being the least offensive Queen imitation. These guys are the Madonnas of old-man emo. \n \n If you had asked me before the fact, I never would have thought that you could market so many Radiohead imitators at the same time. If you had said Thom Yorke\'s help-I-just-choked-on-a-chicken-and-got-the-urge-to-sing vocal stylings would spawn a million followers, clogging up a whole decade in faux alacrity, I would have considered thee mad! Surely the world couldn\'t be that cruel! Then I heard the beginnings of the "Exogenesis" trilogy, a self-congratulatory fusion of Andrew Lloyd Webber\'s "Phantom of the Opera" and Rush\'s "Moving Pictures," and I knew that hell couldn\'t be much worse.\n'

aS"\nI have been with T-Mobile for years and they havent had the best phones. I'm coming from a iphone on tmobile service, so when this phone came out I figured this would be better. NOT at all! \n \n During the first week the phone started freezing terribly, unlike the iphone it takes forever and a day to charge up, the marketplace sucks, the apps are very expensive, the keyboard is stupid and very sensitive which is a problem for me because I'm a fast typer. Sometimes the phone still shows im on a phone call for hours and when im not, and it's not connecting to the mircosoft exchange server for my email. Now the exchange server log in screen pops up every 5-10 mins. Even though the camera has 5 mega-pixels, the photos still are very grainy and not that clear. \n \n I soooooo regret purchasing this phone, and because I've passed my exchanged period (14 days from purchase), my only option now is to sell it.\n"

aS"\nI ordered this as I work in a rough neighborhood.  My boss was stabbed recently outside the office; and another colleague was shot last year.  As I have to walk a bit from the bus; I needed some added protection.  I purchases this item; and it looks fantastic.  I get some odd stares on the bus- but it is pretty intimidating.  The other day; I was mugged and feeling brash in my armor, I told the guy off.  Well- needless to say he went after me.  The knife didn't get through the armor at all.  The blade broke- and rather than being stabbed-- I was pushed over and kicked several times before the mugger ran off.\n \n The only downside is that it is heavy; and it took me about 5 minutes of rolling around on the ground before I could stand up.\n"

aS'\nIngmar right before me says it all. What kind of human being could watch this grotesque, unbelievably carnivorous gore and call it entertainmnet?\n Anyone with eyes and a mind can see that our society will revel in even the worst garbage. Blindly this was ordered and from the cat being wantonly killed and barbequed and fed to a rat is when I SHOULD have stopped but this masterpiece of manure was continued only because Denzel Washington (in my mind) would in a while bring something positive. \n When my morning coffee started to come back up, the movie was put up for sale on Amazon. Shame on me for thinking that anything Washington was in would have to be redeemable. \n HEED MY WORDS: THIS IS NOT FOR ANYONE WITH A FAINT HEART OR AN AWARENESS OF THE VALUE OF LIFE.\n If all Hollywood can come up with is this crap then lets go back to looking at carvings on caves!\n'

aS'\nThis is atrocious.  I\'m watching "Life" on Discovery channel right now, with Oprah narrating.  Some of the reviewers said that the script was re-written for her, and I can believe it.  I can\'t believe Attenborough saying lines like "hunting crab seals is toooo much work!"  Oprah narrates this thing as if she were reading a bedtime story to little kids and comes off as snarky and condescending.  In the opening segment, she\'s discussing a fox chasing an ibex kid and it\'s basically like "heeeere comes the fox!  UH OH!!"\n \n The most embarrassing thing is that I\'m thinking that British people think that Americans demanded this.  Who\'s going to be doing the next special, Dr. Phil?  "Oh-kaaay, here comes the alee-gaytor, it\'s prey tries to run, but that neeeever works!  HAW HAW HAW!"  Don\'t get this.  Get the real version.\n'

aS'\nI\'ve never before written a negative Amazon reader review.  As an author, I know how much they can sting, and I try to limit myself to only reviewing books I\'ve really enjoyed.  However, since the author is long dead, I doubt I can hurt her feelings.  And if by my words I can possibly prevent one other person from undergoing the suffering I\'ve endured, I\'ll feel that my job here is done.\n \n I decided that at the age of 52, it was time I started reading some of the classics that I\'d missed along the way.  I read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE first, and though I found Ms. Austen\'s writing to be tedious, the book was mildly entertaining.  I thought I\'d try Emily Bronte\'s WUTHERING HEIGHTS next.  I\'d always heard how romantic the story was, and no less than three people, upon seeing me with the book, told me, "You\'ll love it!  You\'ll absolutely love it!"\n \n Please tell me you\'re kidding.\n \n This book is wretched.  Painful to a degree I\'ve never before experienced.  I\'ve read books that put me to sleep, books I found impossibly dull, books I found too stupid for words.  But I have NEVER hated a book so much in my life.  The characters in their entirety don\'t possess a single redeeming value.  They are miserable, obnoxious, hateful excuses for human beings.  Even the DOGS are hateful.  Why should I care what happens to any of these awful people?  Why should I care if they\'ve made themselves miserable through their own choices and then spend the rest of the book whining and complaining about how pathetic their lives are?  \n \n I hadn\'t realized just how much I loathed them until halfway through the book, when a major character died, and all I could think was, "THANK GOD!  THANK GOD!"\n \n And then, there\'s the dialect. Ah, the dialect!  I could tolerate it if it was used sparingly.  But when a certain character goes into a speech that lasts for half a page of small print, in a language that can only be described as Not Even Resembling English (yes, I know it\'s supposed to be Scottish), the result is unbearable pain.  Every time this character speaks (which is, thankfully, not often), I find myself puzzling over his words in an attempt to translate them into something that seems even mildly coherent.  Sometimes, it\'s possible to do this just by context.  At other times, I shake my head in bewilderment and disgust and simply move on to a different page.  Considering how slowly the story moves (is there a storyline?  a point to all this suffering?), I could probably skip entire chapters and not miss anything.\n \n I\'d also like to know where the romance is.  Since everybody in this book seems to hate everybody else, with the notable exception of the uncouth monster, Heathcliff, and the spoiled-rotten, obnoxious Catherine, I can\'t fathom where that might lie.  Am I too dense to understand?  Or has the literary world been tricking us for 150 years, convincing the sheep of the world to follow along in praise of this "romantic" classic?\n \n I think I would rather have my fingernails pulled out forcefully, one at a time, than finish reading this book.  I\'m halfway through, and life is short.  Am I really willing to spend that much more of my short time here on earth torturing myself just for the satisfaction of knowing I actually read the dreadful thing?  I think not.\n \n I also think my foray into the classics has ended right here.  I\'m off to read some Robert Parker or Janet Evanovich.  Maybe even some Jackie Collins.  Anything to cleanse my palate of the terrible aftertaste of Heathcliff and Catherine.\n \n To each his own.  I know there are people who rave about this book, people who love it.  I\'m glad somebody does.  Every book deserves to be loved by somebody.  But in this case, with this particular book, that somebody will have to be Somebody Else.  Because it certainly isn\'t me.\n \n \n'

I keep one in each car, on the boat, and in my briefcase.  I may never need it, but if I ever do I don't have to worry about it working.  Magnesium sticks maybe cheap but they are hard to use.

aS"\nThis seemingly underwhelming bit of wire, shrouded in a strange material gave off a strange aura when i stood near. A quick vision from God later and i knew i had to assassinate John Lennon using the mystical powers held within. I was disappointed to see however, after a quick Google search that John Lennon is already dead. His life stolen no doubt, by the previous owner of the very same cable i had come to posses. \n \n A friend of mine also bought this on ebay where it was described as 'Blue Cable'. The vague description suggested that he would be in receipt of the worst kind of Pornography through his TV but instead he recieved 'a blue cable'. Disappointed, he used its strong sheathing to hang himself outside Hugh Hefner's house to drive home his pain.\n"

aS'\nI knew my day was going to improve when the truck pulled up at my home with this cable deep within. No ordinary truck, this one was Holy White, and the gold Delivery logo sparkled like a thousand suns reflected through shards of the purest ice formed with unadulterated water collected at the beginning of the universe. The driver, clad in a robe colored the softest of white, floated towards me on the cool fog of a hundred fire extinguishers. He smiled benevolently, like a father looking down upon his only child, and handed me a package wrapped in gold beaten thin to the point where you could see through it. I didn\'t have to sign, because the driver could see within my heart, and knew that I was pure. Upon opening the package, an angelic choir started to sing, and reached a crescendo as I laid this cable on my stereo system. Instantly, my antiquated equipment transformed into components made from the clearest diamond-semiconductor. The cable knew where to go, and hooked itself into the correct ports without help from me - all the while, the choir sang praises to the almighty digital god. With trepidation, I pushed "play," and was instantly enveloped in a sound that echoed the creation of all matter, a sound that vibrated every cell in my body to perfection. I was instantly taken to the next plane, where I saw the all-father. I knew with my entire soul, that all was good in the world.\n \n But then I realized the cable was blue, so I only gave it one star. I hate blue.\n'

aS"\nI've read several reviews from people who have wished that their Three Wolf Moon shirts had more wolves. It makes sense, right? The more wolves, the better. Yeah, and why don't you paint more angels on The Sistene Chapel, and correct the Mona Lisa's smile? While you're at it, maybe you could add a few tracks to Sgt. Pepper, and make the Great Wall even greater by adding a Starbucks and a Cinnabon. People, it's not like some art school dropout with an airbrush just pulled this design out of his . . . bag of tricks. No. There are three wolves and one moon for a reason.\n \n Don't believe me? Let this be a cautionary tale. Two months ago I had the guy at Shirts Ahoy at the mall press on eleven more wolves. (Two more above the moon; one on each sleeve; six on the back, all howling.) Walking out of the store, I could feel the heat from my freshly pressed wolves, and I figured I was about to have the best day of my life and I should probably buy a lottery ticket. But my first hint that something was not quite right was when I passed three girls in skirts standing in front of Urban Outfitters, and I did not hear the familiar, gentle thud of panties hitting the floor. I figured they must be lesbians and continued to the parking lot. Driving to work, I observed that the other vehicles didn't move out of the way for me, and lights did not automatically turn green as I approached. Very strange. When I got to work, there was actually a pile of unpleasant paperwork where there is normally a giant pile of cash. As I sat at my desk, I began to get a headache and feel hunger, something that hadn't happened to me since I first donned the TWM. I asked a female coworker to help me peel off the eleven new wolves, but she refused and said she was taking back her recent offer to fulfill my every fantasy. So I did it myself. First I removed the six on back, then the two on the sleeves, then I put the shirt back on and removed the three above the moon. When I peeled off the final wolf, the coworker came back in, replaced my paperwork with a Wii, and told me she was reinstating her offer. I then heard a very familiar, gentle thud.\n \n I may not understand the power of the lupine trinity. But hell, I don't understand electricity, or why the sky is blue. But I don't need to understand it; I only need to respect it. I will never mess with my TWM shirt again. I'm even careful when I bend over so I don't add an extra moon, if you know what I mean.\n"

aS'\nThis paradigm-busting film proved to jaded and cynical fin-de-siecle moviegoers that sequels could, by far, surpass their original cinematic inspirations. In the case of B2EB (as I refer to it in my seminal critical study of American musicals and ninja films), those inspirations extend far beyond the original Breakin\', a groundbreaking work in its own right, but to the earliest days of "talkies" and such musically driven films as The Jazz Singer. Sure, The Jazz Singer had Al Jolsen, but Breakin\' 2 has something that its cinematic progenitors could only dream of -- namely, boogaloo.\n'

aS"\nSilly story of uninhibited coitus between two strangers.\n  Melodramatic, common erotica about amazingly endowed lovers. They overcome all odds in their quest for great physical/emotional love.\n   Oh, least I forget, the usual sad, abused pasts for both of our versatile protagonists. Fortunately, the contrived angst didn't overwhelm the salacious narrative.\n  The real story is the sensual appetite of these two lovers. They achieve physical satisfaction in the vertical, horizontal, dorsal and ventral positions, whether clothed or unclothed, in private or in public.\n  Hooray for Passion! What stamina!\n I can not say that this was well written. No.  Nor was there any remarkable literary form or style - excepting the overuse of the common street terms for male and female reproductive organs. \n  The author has used her abilities and energies to create a slight erotic fantasy. The Novel was acceptable. It was not-very-Victorian, not-very-historical, not-very-exciting erotica. \n  Not recommended.\n  \n \n"

The recipe chapter is an expansion of the idea set forth in A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift, but without the political bite.\n \n The rest of the book is composed of Mr. Frumkes forays into the urban jungle.  They tend to be breezy and long-winded, with very little substance.  The observations in the book are good for a giggle, but don't expect a glimpse of the deeper ironies - there weren't any real belly laughs in this book.\n \n If you are in Mensa, this book belongs on your shelf.  However, if you are looking for some meaty humor, you likely won't find it here.\n \n \n"

aS'\nI ordered a Dell Inspiron laptop 1 1/2 years ago and it worked great until recently.  The screen went black and the system would not start.  Turned out that the video card had failed.  \n \n I contacted Dell customer support to activate my next business day warranty and after more than a week I have gotten nowhere with them.  My claim has been "escalated" twice with the same excuses and refusal to fix the problem.  They claim they have no video cards in stock and I will have to wait 2-3 weeks for a replacement card, 2-3 weeks for a loaner system, or 2-3 weeks for a replacement system -- basically my NEXT DAY warranty is anything but.\n \n I explained that this is a mission critical system and a 2-3 week delay is unacceptable given the high price I paid for the next day warranty.  I offered to take another make or model of graphics card and even offered to go buy the card myself if the agreed to pay for it.  \n \n They refused to help in any way.  So, I am left with a useless laptop for 2-3 weeks until it becomes convenient for them to honor the warranty.  I will never buy another Dell product again and recommend that others who are not technically experienced with fixing computers or that need a "mission critical" system that they look elsewhere because Dell cannot be relied upon to fix broken systems in a timely manner.\n'

They said "Customer induced damage to the camera voids the warranty" they want $63 + $10.95 + tax to fix it OR I can send it to them and they will take 15% off a new camera if bought from the Kodak store.  No thanks, first and last time I\'ll buy a Kodak camera.  It\'s going to be a nice paperweight.\n'

aS"\nOkay, I've read the other reviews that call this publication shallow, lacking in depth, geared toward young teenagers, etc.  I guess if you are looking for twenty page, in-depth technical articles that delve into every minute neutron of a particular subject, then yes, this publication might not be what you're looking for.\n \n But, if you're a regular, average, ordinary guy like me (who would not understand those deep, brainy articles anyway) and you are looking for an entertaining, informative view onto what's new and what's cool, I think you'll be pleased.  Very pleased! \n \n Take, for example, a couple of recent issues (see the date of when this review was written).  Last month was focused on the future of personal aviation and the people behind the effort to make personal flight more available and affordable, and about the aircrafts they are inventing.  Fascinating!  Now, can I run out and build myself a prototype after reading the articles?  Ummm, no.  Do I know a whole lot more about an incredibly fun subject then I did before?  Yes!\n \n This month's issue focuses on similar theme: The future of personal space travel and the idea of a space-hotel.  When you're done reading it will you be able to build a rocket and fly to the moon?  Of course not.  But it's informative and educational to the exact level I would want it to be... just enough to make me aware, enlightened, and entertained.\n \n So to all the non-nerds, non-rocket scientists, and non-brainiacs who want a scientific publication by the people, for the people, I think your yearly subscription money will be well spent.\n \n Enjoy!\n"

Unfortunately, with a touchy subject such as race issues in America, it's hard to actually critique a book for its content, instead of its message.  But if you want to see a real piece of art dealing with slavery, watch Amistead...much better.\n"

aS'\nSorry to see Charlaine Harris join the list of writers who are so driven by deadline pressure they can\'t create.  Remember what we all learned in elementary school, faced with that blank sheet of paper?  You can\'t just order up creativity and expect it to be good.  This is the third one of my favorite authors with series pressure to dissapoint.  Beware when an author thanks so many other people for their "help"!  Last time I looked, most great fiction was not written by a committee.  Harris is brilliant, when Harris is writing.  This looked like an outline, with some help from Harris and a lot of suggestions from other people.  People saying, write about Alcide.  Write about politics.  Write about fairy politics, etc.  There is no plot, no main conflict, no main resolution, no basic novel elements.  And we know Harris can write one hell of a plot when she is on her game.  I would rather the publisher just said "Harris has writer\'s block" than churn out this overpriced drivel with her name on it.  I would be willing to wait.  And tell the darn committee to leave her alone.\n'

aS'\nThis book is oversimplified fluff.  The author makes it sound like a person can effortlessly make ends meet without working or by working part time on $6000 a year.  No mention of where that $6000 is supposed to come from (you need more than $150,000 saved up to reliably make $6000 a year).  No mention of how one is supposed to cover health insurance, a home, meals, transportation, travel, etc.  If your dream is to live like a 20 year old, with no responsibilities, no family, and no money, this book is for you.\n \n Several of the people he uses as examples of living the Life or Riley include a 50 year old guy who lives in a used camper, an ex-Domino\'s delivery boy who\'s 27 and plans to ride his bike the rest of his life, and some guy who sings on a street corner.  There was not one example of a husband and wife with several children living his so-called Life of Riley.  $6000 a year?  That\'s called poverty.\n \n Much of the book is quite repetitive.  He must use "write a novel" about a dozen times as a way to spend one\'s time and make money.  You know how difficult it is to write a novel?  I\'d say perhaps 1 in a 1,000 people have the skills to actually write a decent novel.  His list of 300 things to do to keep busy and make enough to get by is trite and laughable.\n \n One good thing he does talk a lot about is don\'t waste your time watching TV (I stopped watching TV about 5 years ago and it was life changing).  Although if you follow his advice, about the only thing you will be able to afford to do is watch TV.\n \n Deciding to retire or seriously cut back your work schedule is not something to take lightly, especially for someone who is under 50 or does not have great health.  The author makes it sound like it\'s a simple process and provides no concrete details on how to make it happen.  Here\'s my advice:  work your butt off, save as much as possible, don\'t buy what you don\'t really need, invest wisely, and know when enough is enough.\n \n There are two far superior books:  Your Money or Your Life and The Millionaire Next Door.\n \n I would only recommend this book to someone who is near retirement age or has the financial means to cut back his or her work schedule.  It has some decent ideas on how to keep busy.\n'

aS'\nPresidents (and those aspiring) these days cannot live as real people. Like the Gods of Greek legend, they have to live in a mythology of their own creation. A Mythology is usually created to explain what is beyond the comprehension of the normal human or to hide secrets that "mere mortals" must be protected from. This book presents the life of Hillary Rodham Clinton as a mythology.\n \n If your a candidate for president today, one of the requirements is a book that tells a false inspirational version of your life story. The books spin every event in the person\'s life to make political points or to shore up what the campaign considers weaknesses. In saying this, I\'m singling out this book or Hillary Clinton. She is by far not the only candidate with a book like this out right now.\n \n The strange thing about Hillary Clinton is that almost nobody really knows her. This book doesn\'t help. \n \n Bernstein follows the established baby boomer script. She was born in an imaginary world of the 1950s that showed up in educational films and the TV show "Happy Days". Like all Boomers, she had a bad father who we are now told was more abusive and cruel than we were told he was before. Her mother was (by the script) a good caring person. \n \n Then she discovers the civil rights movement, Martin Luther King Jr and the turmoil of the 1960s. Thats the script, but it never really happened that way. From other books, the more accurate picture is of the churchy "good girl" from the midwest whose political beliefs were rooted in an attempt to make the world better by "good works".\n \n The book then presents an utterly false account of life at Wellesley. The script has her flowering as a powerful woman ready to take on the world. The book captures the nostalgic view of the times, but not in any way the reality of that time. Berstein spins her up into the spokeswoman for her generation and a national figure in college but again it didn\'t happen that way.\n \n We are then presented with an account of her decision to move to Arkansas that again rings false. Yale Law grads that go to New York or Washington at graduation don\'t go there for idealism, they go there to make money. Neither is a place where she would have found a political future except as a consultant or a lobbyist.\n \n Bernstein then gives a false account of her time in Arkansas which does not deal with the realities of what that meant to her or the adjustments she had make in her life (and appearance) to enhance Bill Clinton\'s electability.\n \n When the scene shifts to Washington, we are given a spin version of the first two disasterous years of the Clinton presidency and a apologist version of her role in that disaster. Everything has a scripted excuse or explaination.  In terms of her qualifications to be president, her failures in 1992-1994 raise the most questions. Explaining away all the problems, as Berstein does, is not helpful. The health care initiative she ran was the biggest (and perhaps only) organization she ran in her life and reading the book its unclear if Berstein (or her) understand all of what she did wrong. \n \n We are then presented with the usual false account of the marriage. She (and the book) play her as the victorian martyr wife tricked by the devious husband. Whatever really goes on in the marriage has never been covered accurately in my opinion by any book. False positive or false negative, what they all have in common is that they ring false.\n \n Then we have the happy ending. She is carried into the senate apparently on a wave of "sympathy". If you want to read about the strong-arming and backroom democratic politics that went into her senate candidacy, this isn\'t the book that will tell you.\n \n The book ends with the heroic sunset photo of her with her valued advisor, husband by her side, preparing to "save" the world by running for president. \n \n This book is like a sappy made-for-TV movie about the life of Hillary Clinton. This is a person who cries out for a real biography but all we get is either demonization from right-wing cranks or political spin like this book. Her real life story (an honest one) would be an interesting read, but to be honest it would not serve her purpose or get her elected.\n \n It would be nice of our presidents and presidental aspirants could return to being human beings. But with presidential "libraries" these days resmebling temples of worship, the trend seems unlikely to go away.\n'

It's all about, you know, who winds up shagging who, just like every other vapid soap opera on tv. I mean come on people, do you REALLY care what the island was supposed to be in the end? Isn't the intellectual thrill ride that is the Jack/Kate/Sawyer/Juliet relationship roller coaster far better to have all the answers to? And I know I know, the flash sideways had nothing, absolutely nothing to do with anything that happened in the first 5 seasons of LOST, nor did they have anything to do with anything that happened on the island or to the characters while they were alive, but aren't you glad to finally, at the end of this 6 season saga, find out what they were really all about?\n \n Season 6 is a classic example of the bait and switch, or of, wait for it...

aS'\nI own all of the current major consoles, PS3, XBOX 360 and Wii.  They all have their pluses and minuses and my feelings for the PS3 is that its a a great BluRay player but I have no love for it as game system.  All of my family uses the Wii, we own 2 XBOX 360s due to my kids and myself wanting to play it but the PS3 only gets used for movies.  I originally planned to use it as a second game system but there are few originals while the XBOX has tons of exclusives not availble for PS3(Halo, Gears of War, Forza, Mass Effect etc).  But the biggest drawback for me personally is that the PS3 controller is the same size and design as the one introduced 15 years ago on the original Playstation.  Sure, its wireless now but its too small and not ergonomic(unless you are a child or chimpanzee).  The new slimline is slightly nicer than the old toaster but it is still not stackable due to its curved case.  For some reason Sony thinks the Playstation needs to handle well in wind tunnels.  The "sleek" design may come in handy when I toss it out the window to replace with a normal Bluray player. So in short if you want a Bluray player, buy a Bluray player, if you want a great game system, buy an XBOX, and if you want a spoiler for your car, buy a PS3.\n'

aS'\nSex For Dummies: I saw this book while perusing Amazon, and could not believe it. Not only is this company marketing their products to mentally-challenged people, but they are doing it right out in the open! Surely the mentally-handicapped, who oftentimes work menial jobs for little or no pay, need their money more than any other group? But no, this soulless corporation keeps churning out their books designed to take our slower brothers\' and sisters\' last dime. How exactly are the books "For Dummies?" I\'m not sure; perhaps they have large, colorful pictures or have scratch-and-sniff components. No matter, the point still stands that this company is trying to take advantage of the mentally-impared and must be stopped. \n And furthermore, "Sex for Dummies?" Really? I\'m as liberal as the next guy, but are the mentally-challenged really the kind of people we want reproducing? I\'m not saying we round them up into camps or anything, but if you can figure out a way to keep `em childless, so much so the better. \n To conclude: Not only does this book take advantage of the less-fortunate, but it strives to create a world in which there are even more of said less-fortunate. Two stars. \n \n'

aS"\nFirst of all, where was the Edward and Bella romance that we got in Twilight? I couldn't find it. His character was almost nonexistent. The wedding was too rushed, the honeymoon... not a single intimate conversation. Not really one. About what it was like to be married, how they finally felt about everything that had gotten them to this point, what they hoped for the future, nothing. I felt cheated.\n \n Then the pregnancy... just yuck, how Bella lit up every time Jake came over, meanwhile, Edward's going out of his mind and she seems to just not address that. Did it not occur to her how it would make Edward feel when she did stuff like that with Jake? Her constant disregard for his feelings never ceased to amaze me. And we're supposed to like her for this?\n \n I have to admit, I loved the delivery scene, with Edward having to deliver the baby and her just spewing blood from everywhere. Too bad Jake was there, but it was impossible to shake him, thanks Steph. If they ever make a movie of this one, I want to see that scene.\n \n I must say, I have read better transformation scenes in fanfiction. That was weak, but, I like Bella as a vamp much better than as a human. It really helped that she finally cut Jake loose and realized she belonged to Edward. Finally! It took her becoming a vamp for that to happen? How stupid was she as a human?\n \n Then the imprinting. Just weird and creepy. Almost incestuous; just a few days earlier, Jacob is having fantasies about having sex with Bella. Then suddenly, he wants her daughter. Creeped me out big time. Why couldn't he imprint on Angela or even Tanya?\n \n Oh, I know why, because it wouldn't have fit into the whole bizarro ending she had planned, with the wolves intimidating the Volturi. I did like Seth though; if anyone had to imprint on the kid, I wished it was him. I also thought Sam would die so Jake would have to become Alpha. But, no, nobody has to die in Stephenie's little dream world except for evil Irina, who was simply mistaken and jumped to the wrong conclusion. Off with her head.\n \n Oh yeah, I loved how Jake took it upon himself to go tell Charlie, just to keep them from going out of town for a few months. How selfish can you be? How inconsiderate? Just another example of how he disrespects Bella's decisions. Still supposed to be her best friend and still unable to be supportive. If he couldn't stand the separation, why didn't he just go with them? They weren't going to the moon.\n \n I hate Renesmee but I like it better than Nessie. Couldn't they have called her Rennie.. or what about sticking Elizabeth in there somewhere for Edward's mother? But nothing tops Edward Jacob. I almost barfed. I'm sure Edward wanted to name his son that. What was Stephenie on when she wrote this???\n \n I was never worried that E and B wouldn't end up together. She's not THAT stupid. But I didn't see the baby or the imprinting coming. I thought we resolved the love triangle in Eclipse, but at the reception, there it was again. I wanted to scream and I wanted to slap Bella, and therefore, Stephenie. Jake is hugging her, so Edward comes back and Jake's stink is all over her Wedding Dress. Funny, it occurred to me but it didn't occur to Bella. She's always so worried about hurting Jake but she doesn't seem to worry about hurting Edward.\n \n The only time she did seem to consider his feelings was when she was trying to hide her own pain, with the pregnancy and the transformation. The only time. She could hang onto Jake all she wanted with never a backward glance in Edward's direction. Did Stephenie do that on purpose or did she just think that was acceptable behavior? Is she completely insensitive?\n \n Talk about a big build up with no climax... let's just chit chat with Aro and then glare at each other and then they'll turn around and go back to Italy. Yeah, that's a great ending; what a let down.\n \n And a love shield? Yeah, I like Lily Potter too, but I would try to come up with something original for my fourth novel, not something that's already been done by JK Rowling. And since when was Bella's love her strongest human trait? Her closed mind, yes, love shield, no.\n"

aS'\nWhile from a purely academic standpoint this book is informative, interesting, and overall excellently written, it has a far greater purpose than simply to satisfy idle curiosity.  Monkeys and apes exist as one of the greatest threats to mankind.  I submit as evidence the multiple cases of chimps just flipping out and going bananas on their owners, often biting off noses, fingers, and testes, or even killing their comparatively helpless victims.  A 90 pound chimp is more than a match for most fully grown men.  Capuchins, while seemingly innocuous due to their diminutive stature and "cute" appearance, are possibly the worst of the bunch.  Disturbingly self-aware, capuchins (as described in this book) are probably the most intelligent of the new world monkeys, possessing exceptionally large brains for their body size (second only to humans).  In addition, Michelle Press does an excellent job of describing some of the more frightening actions of these simian killing machines, including forming totem poles of up to four monkeys piled on top of each other as they converge on their doomed prey.  I encourage anyone at all concerned about the growing threat of capuchin dominance to read this book in order to stem the tide of the marmoset menace.  The next person they go ape on could be you.\n'

aS'\nBefore you can actually use this product you first must accustom your pet to the PediPaws. Unless he or she is in a coma, your pet will absolutely despise the sound and vibration of it. Don\'t let that deter you! As the caring, dedicated pet owner that you are, you will persevere! \n \n After one very long week, I learned that Sophie the dog is more patient than stubborn, and grudgingly learned to "put up" with the tool. However, Fuzzy the cat refused to do the same--he saw no need to suffer fools gladly.\n \n The experience revealed two major drawbacks with the PediPaws: It files the nail in miniscule amounts at a time and can only be used in bursts of 7 seconds or so. (If used longer, the heat generated through friction could injure your pet.) If your dog\'s nails are overlong, this project could take you days---maybe weeks. Even if the nails were recently trimmed, you will have to constantly file them to maintain that length.\n \n If you and your pet are extraordinarily patient, you would probably not even worry about purchasing this product, but you might enjoy the challenge of using it nonetheless. If you find it hard to resist a new gadget or power tool, I recommend buying the complete Dremel Drill Tool Set. That way, when you abandon using it to file nails, you will be able to find less dubious uses for it.\n \n As for myself, I intend to keep it and, during evenings while watching TV, I will file my own nails. It is my hope that its sound, vibration and heat will remind me to never again purchase anything that is: "As Seen On TV."\n \n'

aS'\nIf you are considering getting this trimmer, all you need to know is this: The 9 lockable length settings don\'t actually lock!! I tried putting it on length "3", but when I started to trim, it went down to length "2".  Then I started on length 2 and it went down to length 1.  Besides this, the cutting block is too far away from the thing that touches your face (not sure what it\'s called), so it\'s very hard to cut any hair at all unless you choose the length setting 3 or lower.  I know all this may come as a surprise to those of you who have had success with previous Norelco trimmers, but the fact is that this thing is a serious piece of Sh_t.  In my estimation, their aspirations to achieve the fancy "vacuum effect" has clouded what should be their primary goal with this device: to trim facial hair EVENLY and EFFECTIVELY!  I would have given this 0 stars if it would have been an option.\n'

aS'\nI purchased one yesterday and was very excited to try it out.  It was so cool looking and easy to manuver.  I eagerly turned on the machine and made a few easy strokes..... huh? Something must be wrong.  It didn\'t even erase the footprints in the carpet and the suction was ok at best.  I switched off the brush bar and looked in the end, nothing was wrong.  I called customer service and after about 15 minutes on the phone with them figured out it was working properly. What the heck?\n I expected this thing to suck so hard that it would lift the carpet and create perfecty groomed rows of nap...like a freshly plowed field.  Not even close it barely even combed the top of the fibers.\n \n Problem #1-No height adjustment for the brush bar.  It barely even touches the carpet.  Not enough to even give you that "just vacuumed" look.  Talk about a suction leak.\n Problem #2-It doesn\'t have very good sucking power.  My old Bissel sucked 2x as hard as this dyson.  Even the guy on the customer care line said it only moved about 50CFM of air compared to my old vacuum that moved much much more. \n \n Don\'t belive the marketing hype.  It\'s not worth the money.  Ever wonder why consumer reports ranks the cleaning ability of the Dyson as average?  Because it is.  Consumer reports is dead on in their review.  It\'s just not that good of a cleaner.\n Sure it looks cool and you can park it in the driveway to impress your neighbors... but as far as cleaning my carpets, this vacuum sucks - Not in a good way.\n I took it back to the store a few hours later and got my money back.  If I want a vacuum that cleans just OK then I\'m not going to pay [...] bucks.  The 99 dollar ones at Target work just as good, if not better.\n \n \n'

aS'\nAnybody who is familiar with Eric Alterman\'s conservative bashing and rantings from "The Nation" and "Altercation" on MSNBC.COM will be instantly familiar with this book. Eric\'s leanings are so far to the left that he makes Bill and Hillary Clinton look conservative. Most of Eric\'s writings are obviously filled with hate for George W. Bush. If the President said the sky was blue, Eric\'s column in "The Nation" or "Altercation" on MSNBC.com would say the sky was Red. Eric\'s rantings are so skewed to the left, that it\'s easy to see that his book is fired by his hatred for anything conservative and how he twists the facts to justify his point. Anybody who watches CNN, MSNBC, or any the major network broadcasts can obviously tell that the Liberals are in control of the networks and their broadcast agenda. Fox News is the only network that offers an honest and fair presentation of the news without the obvious liberal bias of the other media news shows. Also Eric forgets to tell us that Liberals are in control of most major newspapers in the United STates. It\'s obvious to anyone who reads a newspaper in the United States. Also MSNBC.com has a leftist bias. Eric Alterman\'s "Altercation" and Jill Nelson\'s op-ed pieces on MSNBC.com show just how liberal msnbc.com is in it\'s news reporting. Eric has no regard for the United States. He\'s typical of the liberals in Ann Coulter\'s book "Treason" that wish to destroy the United States from within. Eric has no regard for United States law unless it can be twisted to serve his politically correct and leftist anti-american agenda. Eric thinks he knows more about Constitutional law than the Supreme Court when he says that the Supreme Court was wrong and George W. Bush is the Commander in Theif. Eric forgets to tell us that the US Supreme Court stepped in to stop the Democratic controlled Florida Supreme Court from rewriting election law after the fact of the election to help Al Gore steal the election from George W. Bush. The Democratic controlled Florida Supreme court was guilty of changing the rules after the election has occured which violates Federal Election Law and the US Constitution. Eric also conveniently forgets to tell us that the President is determined by the electoral college and not the popular vote. It\'s in the constitution, yet he conveniently overlooks things that disagree with his leftist liberal and anti-american viewpoints. Eric Alterman\'s documentation standards practice the normal liberal method of cross polination. Cross pollination is when one liberal writes an article or book with no factual backing and then another liberal author references the book to back up his non-truthful claims. Very little of Eric\'s documenation for his book comes from the mainstream media or verifiable sources. Most of his documentation comes from unverifiable questionable sources in the liberal community. The footnotes and endnotes look real impressive if you don\'t question their validity or their sources. Most of his footnotes and endnotes come from nonverifable sources and have very little factual support behind them. Anybody who wasted their money on Eric\'s rantings deserves their money back.\n'

aS"\n`Blonde jokes', Bella talking non-stop about her incredible beauty, endless petty fighting between characters, rampant antifeminism, a disturbing anti-human sentiment, paedophilia.\n Stephenie Bella Meyer Swan is back and as self-absorbed and nasty as ever.\n \n Adjectives and adverbs are used to a laughable point. And the repetition is painful. Everyone's got `tight eyes', and Alice is always `dancing' everywhere.\n \n Meyer trots out another string of beautiful blondes to show us how undesirable they are to her heroes. Can anybody say `wish fulfilment'?!\n \n The Mormon overtones are so obvious it's frightening nobody much thinks about it. The Mormon-style baby naming of combining family names. Meyer attended Brigham Young University - a Mormon university - where they are constantly told to marry young and start reproducing; which is exactly what Bella Sue does. There's a frightening anti-abortion message: even if your spawn rips your body to shreds - kills you - you MUST fight everybody to keep it. Imprinting is essentially what Mormon `sealing' is.\n And, no doubt, Meyer pays tithings, which would mean every year the fans are sending millions of dollars to the Mormon church.\n How is it Americans were up in arms about a bit of magic in British Harry Potter books, but they're happy with paedophilia and religious propaganda in American Twilight books?\n \n We've got more `werewolves' (sorry - at the very end of the book they are suddenly `shapeshifters') falling in love with babies. But don't worry, one special baby is going to be ready for sexual duties by her seventh birthday. How romantic.\n \n The unintentionally hilarious scenes of the happy family - accompanied by paedophile Jacob - dressed to the nines, running off into the forest to guzzle on wild animals, tip this already ridiculous book even further over the edge.\n \n The appeal of the initial story was the contrast between Bella's humanity and Edward's immortality. The moment Bella wakes up a wild huntress superhero in possession of a `love shield' we lose any possible connection we could have had with her, as she divides her time between admiring her own beauty and fantasising sexually about her husband (even when covered in blood, in a ripped cocktail dress, barefoot and in the middle of a forest).\n \n And how about those deux ex machinas?! Isn't it great how every time there's a problem something miraculous pops up out of the blue to save the day? So once again none of our characters have to actually solve a problem, or - you know - do something.\n \n Additionally, I have no idea how any intelligent or sane person can remain a Twilight fan after reading about Edward EATING mutant vampire baby spawn out of his wife. Romantic it is not.\n \n This series is a disaster, but no installment so much as this final one.\n \n I hope the next tween fad makes an appearance soon. Stephenie Meyer is definitely not deserving of any more money.\n \n Avoid this ridiculously long mess.\n \n"

aS"\nHello, I live in the shadow of the largest casino in the Western hemisphere. As a compulsive gambler and liar, this is both a boon and a burden; I only make enough money gambling to continue gambling, because I was fired from my job for gambling. My dream was to work at the casino, where I could get more money to spend at the casino. However, all of the people who work at the casino are Native Americans and they were probably racist (at my white). I applied for a job more times than I can count on my nine fingers, but they always threw me out of the interview, usually before I could even vomit.\n \n But one day, I was browsing amazon.com and I stumbled upon The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee (tm) while I was looking for Mountain Dew and wolves, and I knew that things were about to change for me. I sold my year's supply of food stamps to a wino for about 30 bucks, and immediately signed up for an account and sent the shirt to my mom's house.\n \n Tense. Joy. Nervous. Happy. These words and more are words that I thought or felt as I ripped into the box with my claws that I made from biting my nails into points, being careful not to damage the 100% cotton fibers. I put on the shirt right away, hopped the bus to the casino and requested a job interview.\n \n The managers were already very familiar with me, but when they stood up to physically eject me from the room, they noticed my The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee. They were transfixed for over seven-and-a-half minutes. One of their noses started to bleed. The shirt spoke to them, as it had spoken to me. They knew that there was something special about this shirt, and about this man wearing it before them. They knelt on the ground, waved some herbs around, and turned down the AC to make a makeshift sweat lodge--this was the real deal. I could tell, because I think they did something like that on Dances with Wolves or something (wolves, again).\n \n Before long, I was accepted into the tribe as one of the members. They offered me a beautiful native virgin, and I have been talking to her on Facebook to see if she is the type of girl I might want to see a movie with (probably not, unless she gets a tattoo on her lower back or ankle). I also got a dog.\n"

When the Library Journal review says "Not recommended," believe them!  I bought this from the $1 bin at a bookstore sale, and paid too much.  I was hoping to find a look into some of the inner workings of the FBI and some good stories.  Instead, I got a 210 page diatribe on how awful "that Clinton crowd" and "those Clinton people" were.  Aldrich chose the most unprofessional way possible for an "insider" to complain about the lack of professionalism of the Clinton administration.  (I did at least enjoy the irony - but not quite enough to give this piece of trash even one star.)  Whining about the Clinton\'s Christmas decorations?!!  He also makes it clear that he knew from day one that they were all going to be bad news because some of the men had earrings and pony tails!  And one woman dressed in all black and wore black fingernail polish, so he knew she was "unsuitable."\n \n In this incredibly biased drivel, Aldrich manages to insult ALL Southerners, ALL liberals, ALL Democrats, ALL people in their 20\'s and 30\'s, ALL people who listen to rock music, and on and on and on.  He clearly believe that all people are homogeneous within groups that he can readily identify instantly by a few characteristics.  And he makes it clear that ALL Clinton administration people were horrible people, criminals, liars, drug users (and dealers).\n \n If you see this piece of garbage in the $1 bin, save your money!

aS'\nFirst of all, I believe that children are a blessing as the Bible states. One blessing is that it keeps parents from living a self-centred life (a sin) and helps them become more like Jesus. I also firmly believe that having more children than you can take care of/support is a sin as well. When looking at the various types of birth control there are some that prevent fertilization and others that prevent implantation of the fertilized egg in the womb. The majority of pills do the later. Birth control using methods that prevent the embryo from living further breaks the commandment of "Thou shalt not kill" and constitutes a sin. I would love to hear what others think about these statements.\n'

It's very comfortable and not too heavy. It fits perfectly in the storage compartment under my moped seat, which is great if you don't want it to get stolen or have to carry it wherever you're going.\n"

aS"\nOk, I am an old time monkey Island game fan.  I have played them all, and I think this is the best one yet.  I like the cartoon like cinematic style, voice acting is great, and the puzzles are (mostly) fair.  We all gather round and play as a family.  Great puzzle solving fun for parents and kids together.\n \n The user interface isn't perfect. Dragging Guybrush around with the mouse can be a bit difficult(you can also use the arrow keys on the keyboard), and sometimes the camera angles can be a problem.  Also the lip sync is terrible, which is a little distracting at first. \n \n You can subscribe to all 5 episodes at once and get a break on the single episode price(I did).  At this writing, only the first 2 episodes are available, with new ones scheduled monthly.\n"

This came up as a gold box deal, so I thought what the heck and ordered it, as I had seen many positive reviews of the eMedia software.  I received the package and it was *very* light.  I opened it up and laughed as it looked like a kids toy.  I decided that I better not waste my money and returned this kit and to go ahead and invest in a decent starter instrument (I bought a Seagull Coastline S6 Burst GT Guitar ).

The book will help the reader realize the depth of President Bush's Christian faith and what motivates his leadership. He has always seemed sincere to me, but now through this book he has become even more real. It seems he cares about all aspects of our nation and each individual in it. Read this book for a fresh perspective and get away from the rehtoric of the common media.\n"

aS"\nJudging from the advertisements, Moon seemed to be about a man going slowly insane on, well, the moon. I assumed it was more of a movie like Event Horizon, where a lonely person stumbles on some mind-blasting truth. Fortunately, I was wrong. \n \n Actually, that's an accurate description of the film - it's jut that the mind-blasting truth is eminently relatable and human. Moon's a lot more complicated than it looks. \n \n Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the sole inhabitant of a moon base dedicated to mining Helium-3 for Lunar Industries.  His companion is GERTY (Kevin Spacey), a ceiling-hung robot that expresses itself through emoticons. For three years, Sam has overseen the various mining robots, worked on his wooden models, talked to his plants, and longed to be reunited with his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) and daughter Eve (Rosie Shaw). With his time up, he's ready to go home. The catch is that Sam perceives everything through a filtered lens - even his transmissions to Earth are delayed.  Sam isn't just alone for three months; he's alone without any synchronous human contact.  \n \n Red herrings abound. It's easy to focus on the HAL-like robot GERTY, a major character and foil for Sam. How can you trust something that sounds so benign as Kevin Spacey? Ironically, GERTY is one of the most human characters on the base. \n \n Moon's twist isn't in the revelation of The Truth, but in its implications.  Moon questions who Sam is, what he represents, and what makes him - and us - human.  We are, the director seems to say, defined by our memories, and that's enough to fuel us in our daily grind.  Sam is every worker who has been at it for years, always waiting for the next big break, the next reorganization, the next lotto ticket that will get him out of the crappy dead end job. It's a lot like Memento, high praise for a film that cost just $5 million to produce.\n \n The fun is in watching Sam deal with the truth of his situation and how he rises above it (or succumbs to it). Moon is littered with clues, making it worth another view. This is a tightly crafted, smart film that takes a single science fiction element and explores it thoroughly.  \n \n"

aS'\nThe keyboard on this notebook is the highlight, it has great feedback, separated chicklet keys, and has standard key placement (unlike some funky keyboards I have tried recently).  That is to say, delete in top right, escape top left and CTL bottom left, with arrow keys on the bottom right.  Also, it doesn\'t have the rarely needed numeric keypad, which is found on a lot of keyboards these days but requires your hand placement left of expected to type, which is what you do most of the time anyhow, right?  I like this keyboard better than those on the legendary Thinkpads of old.\n \n The screen is nice and sharp, I don\'t dislike the shiny screen as much as I had originally expected.  Colors are great.\n \n Hard drive has enough space for me, and the recovery procedure works well.  I made the recovery CDs as well, but I normally just clone the HD onto and old drive to have a backup that way. \n \n The computer has nice selection of features, minus the HDMI that has been mentioned already.  \n \n I am very fond of the trackpad .. I grew up with IBMs and prefer the pointer stick, but this is the nicest trackpad I\'ve ever used.  Buttons are in the right places and are the right size.\n \n Speakers are OK, better than many budget laptops.  The recessed keyboard is a nice looking design and the textured case is also quite cool looking.  This certainly doesn\'t look like a budget laptop. \n \n There are a few negatives however.  First, Sony loads a ridiculous amount of "junkware" on this computer.  Trial versions of this and that, utilities of dubious importance, and a bunch of other junk I see no need for.  I took me about 45 minutes to get rid most of the egregious stuff.  The processor is 64 bit, and the Win7 version is 64 bit, which makes sense given the 4GB ram installed.  The processor does not have the Intel virtualization technology, but frankly having used Sun\'s free and excellent Virtual Box software for some time, which doesn\'t need this virtualization technology, I see no need for Intel\'s hardware virtualization.  \n \n Also, the computer ain\'t a light weight although it isn\'t a complete pig either.  \n \n I also installed XP Professional for giggles, the drivers are all available on Sony\'s site.  Man, it really flies with 32 bit XP.  \n \n All in all a very nice budget laptop.\n'

aS'\nI began my search for an LCD HDTV/Monitor over a month ago and purchased 4 other similar items before purchasing this ViewSonic VT2430 and returned the previous 4 for poor performance.  I was actually looking for a unit which included a DVD player for use in training lectures.  But, I couldn\'t find the right combination so I decided to settle on a unit without the DVD player, since those that are built in are all cheap players.  This way, by keeping the TV and the DVD player separate I can always update the player as needed (BlueRay!).\n \n   I looked at a LOT of HDTV/Monitors and chose the VT2430 for its native 1920x1080 pixel resolution.  This works out perfectly with the 1920x1080i signals coming via my cable.  And...the pictures are absolutely stunning!  More so than I even expected, even already knowing the quality of Viewsonic monitors.   And there are plenty of options for modifying and managing the images from all inputs.  One reason for returning a Toshiba unit was that it\'s native resolution is 1680x1050 pixels, which, when fed a 1920x1080 pixel signal (HDTV) stretches the image vertically...without any way of correcting the distortion.  In fact, the manual states that "image size adjustments are not available with 720i and 1080i signals"!  VERY poor planning as most cable signals are either 790i or 1080i. \n \n   The PC image obtained with the VT2430 is absolutely awesome.  I\'m typing this review with this monitor with the resolution set at 1920x1080, a perfect match with my PC.  There are at least 10 other resolution settings that work as well - just lower resolution results.  Regardless of the resolution sent from my PC, the VT2430 automatically adjusts for the best picture with each setting.  Very neat.\n \n The audio was another problem I found with all of the other units I tried.  Most of them were either too low in volume or, when the volume was turned up became very distorted.  Not so with the VT2430.  Plenty of clean sound at all volume settings, including loud enough for filling the rooms where I do my training.\n \n The image I get from my (LG) DVD player, which upgrades to a 1080i output via an HDMI cable, is very good.  I also have a BlueRay player which puts out a 1080p signal, which, again, perfectly matches the resolution of the VT2430, for a beautiful picture.\n \n   The overall picture of this monitor is far more accurate, clean, and viewable than any of the other monitors I looked at.  The dynamic range is very wide, including the darker colors and grays and blacks, not quite up to my 52-in Samsung (Over $2,300!), but closer than any other comparable sized monitor.\n \n   Physically, I like the fact that the monitor can be tilted back for watching from higher positions.  Also, the flat stand can be quickly removed for transporting in its original box, which I do often when I\'m training.\n \n Great monitor.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I would, however, downgrade its rating by 1/2 point for not having a DVD player.  But, that is not what it is!  ViewSonic does sell an LCD HDTV/DVD Combo monitor, but it has a lower pixel rate designed more for 720i resolution, which is OK for most uses at this smaller size.  But, having been a TV studio tech in charge of adjusting and maintaining studio monitors, I became too picky and always need(!) the best.\n'

aS'\nI was skeptical, but a bit desperate. Now in my 50\'s, I have been noticing a steady decline in the number, the thickness and the length of my eye lashes, both upper and lower. And I did not like it! I did not know such a thing existed until I saw it on an end cap at the grocery store. Pricey....hmmmm....but if it works....would be so worth it.\n \n I apply it in the morning with my AM makeup routine making sure it is dry before I apply any another product on or near my lashes (eyeshadow, mascara, cover-up, etc.) I opted for the morning time, because a night task like that just did not work for me, even though the instructions say to do it at night.\n \n It seems it took the 4 weeks before I started to see changes I could believe were happening. My lashes are now much longer and thicker and hold the curl much better. Its like Rogaine for the eyes!\n \n I guess it is to be a life-long task for me, but the longer lashes sure do add a lot of life to the aging eye! Maybe the price will go down one day!\n \n Oh, I have not noticed any darkening on the skin near the lashes. Occasionally I get some mild burning while it dries. I "think" I felt some weird eye aching in the first week, but that has gone away. I was not sure it was from the "medicine", but chose to live with it!\n'

The large screen makes data input easier. Like all TomToms, you can configure it to your liking. \n \n The only negative is that battery life is reduced because of the larger, brighter screen.\n'

aS"\nDoes exactly what it should do, fits the iphone snugly and definitely improves battery life DRAMATICALLY.\n \n To answer some of the common questions:\n 1. The on/off switch turns the battery back on or off - not sure why you'd want to turn it off, but if you do, the iphone will run on its own battery.  When on, the iphone will first drain the pack, then its own battery.\n 2. Charging - it charges via standard micro USB, and yes, you charge the phone just by connecting the case (no need to charge separately).  The one time you may want to separate them is if the pack is dead and you iphone is close to dead, since the pack needs to get a bit of a charge before it will charge the iphone...\n \n Which brings me to how the thing ACTUALLY works: yes, it's a battery, however your iphone will simply treat it as though it is plugged into a wall outlet/usb cable: you'll see the plugged in symbol, and charging symbol on the iphone screen.  Once the battery pack dies, that turns off.  It's pretty ingenious actually.\n \n On the back of the device are 3 LED lights showing if it's fully charged: when all 3 are lit, it's full...when 1 is lit, its 1/3 etc.  Any way you slice it, this is a TREMENDOUS improvement over the battery life of my rapidly failing 3G battery.\n \n Pros: Extends battery life dramatically, fits securely around iphone 3G, charges with standard micro USB cable\n Cons: Adds a substantial amount of weight to the device, takes a decent amount of time to get a good charge, will not fit into any iphone docks (ipod dock connector does not stock out of case) -  this includes ANYTHING you connect to in the past (car kits too) - so if you still want to use those, you will need to remove the bottom of the case.  While it feels fairly sturdy, I'm not sure how much of that kind of abuse it can take.\n"

aS'\nI bought this drive when Amazon offered it in the Gold Box for $8 and it is definitely worth it. I know that there has been some criticism of this drive for not having a cap or it\'s clean design. Neither of these points bother me and they certainly do not impact the performance of the drive. Put simply, if you\'re reading customer reviews because you want to know how well the drive performs, keep reading. If you\'re more concerned about a "pretty" drive, this isn\'t the review for you.\n \n So far the drive has lived up to its selling points. I have three machines on Windows 7, one on Vista Premium and a netbook on Windows XP. I didn\'t have any problems using the drive with any of my machines. I am an avid photographer and I used several large photo files as well as some home videos to test this drive. File transfers to and from the drive were as fast as I\'ve seen with other flash drives costing more. It really is a speedy little drive. This is also a good drive for ReadyBoost.\n \n I\'ve only had this drive for a couple of days and cannot make any claims as to long term reliability just yet but I\'ve had good luck with other Toshiba products.\n'

aS"\nWhen I saw this item for sale I just had to buy one for my husband as a college graduation gift. Margaritas are his favorite drink and he just couldn't duplicate that restaurant quality consistancy with a blender. This Margaritaville machine actually shaves the ice instead of chopping it like a blender would do. This creates that nice smooth consistancy of the drink instead of a lumpy texture. \n \n It's very easy to operate. All you do is fill the ice chamber with ice, pour the correct amout of your drink mixture into the pitcher (it will make 1-3 servings at a time), set the machine to how many servings you would like, then turn it on. The machine automatically measure,shaves and blend the perfect amount of ice according to the amount of servings. No more watery drinks.\n \n When my kids have friends over for pool parties they love me to make them alcohol free strawberry daiquiris or pina coladas or fruit smoothies. \n \n One nice feature about this machine is that as the ice in the ice chamber melts, the water is channeled into a collection reservoir, that is easily removeable to dump out. The water never mixes with the drink mix.\n \n Clean-up is simple. Whatever ice remains in the ice chamber can be left to melt and drain into the reservoir then discard it or you can have the machine shave the remaining ice into the pitcher. We put our pitcher and pitcher parts into the dishwasher for a good cleaning.\n \n If you are a frozen drink lover, like my husband and I are you have to own one of these. It's pricey but worth it!\n \n I also, highly recommend the canvas carrying case that can be purchased separately. It's very nicely made.\n"

However, after eagerly awaiting this release I was very disappointed to find this album is the censored version!

I am outraged and shocked that a GaGa record would even be released as a censored and edited version. I understand that some people may choose to buy censored music, but I do not as I am an adult and feel that I should have the right to make my own choices about what I listen to. The censoring is really annoying because it sounds as if there is a skipping glitch in the flow of the songs.

aS'\nWilliam Golding wrote this book as a response to &quot;Coral Island,&quot; in which a group of boys shipwrecked on an island make Christians out of cannibals, hunt pigs but do not spill blood, and are cheerfully rescued. Obviously, Lord of the Flies is much more than an adventure story about good little boys. It is an exploration into the darker side of man and the true source of the \x1abeast,\x1a or Devil.  Meet Ralph, who represents sanity, common sense, and the \x1aconscience\x1a of man; Jack, who loves nothing more than hunting, blood, and power, and who Freudians might say embodies the Id; Piggy, who personifies intelligence, logic, and reason; and Simon, who discovers the true nature of the beast and represents a ray of hope for mankind.  I love this book because contained in less than 200 pages is an insight into human nature and the failings of society. When you read this, be prepared not only to examine the book and all its symbolism but yourself and your civilization.\n'

aS'\nThis book, nearly 800 pages, analyzes in exhaustive detail Ken Starr\'s investigation as independent prosecutor of President Clinton. \n \n Two things stand out about this book. \n \n First, the colossal amount of research that went into it. Gormley interviewed not only all the major players in the events, including Starr, Clinton, and Monica Lewinsky, but also hosts of minor characters, relatives, attorneys, and the like. I have rarely read any book on any subject that interviewed so many different people in so much depth, many of them ordinarily difficult to find. \n \n Gormley\'s extreme diligence pays off as he uncovers tragic but mesmerizing details that are not widely known. For example, he has a detailed account of Jim McDougal\'s death in solitary confinement including information based on his interviews with McDougal\'s prison psychologist. He also uncovered a report highly critical of the prosecutors\' interrogation of Monica Lewinsky, which criticizes the prosecutors for continuing to question her after she had requested an attorney. What was particularly interesting is that the report was never released because, allegedly, its release would have violated the privacy, not of Lewinsky - but of her prosecutors! One of the most interesting features of this book is that while the FBI was devoting enormous investigative resources to the question of whether the president committed perjury in his Jones deposition, Clinton was sending missiles against al-Qaeda threats in Afghanistan. Some of the participants expressed exasperation that law enforcement did not consider anti-terrorism investigation a higher priority than the Jones deposition issues.\n \n The second great thing about this book is that it\'s so clear and easy to read. Although it covers events over twenty years, innumerable legal proceedings and lawsuits, it\'s paced so that it\'s nearly impossible to put down. It\'s one thing to collect all this information, but the author also managed to have it tell an incredible tale: at times tragic, at times infuriating, at times laughable - but always fascinating.\n \n Nevertheless, the book had a few weaknesses.\n \n One omission generally was that the details of the legal arguments tended to be glossed over.\n \n For example, there is no analysis of Clinton\'s arguments that he did not commit perjury in his testimony in the Paula Jones deposition, which are important to understand the merits of his defense. In general, the author sometimes appears to conflate similar terms for specific acts in ways the confuse the issue about perjury. \n \n As the legal discussion, on page 172 the author describes a bill that would allow certain private litigants to sue sitting presidents as one that would "almost certainly have violated the U.S. Constitution\'s command against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws." This statement seems too strong. Ex post facto laws do not ordinarily circumscribe civil liability, and a bill as described could probably be drafted so as to withstand a bill of attainder challenge. \n \n I would also have wanted to read a more detailed analysis of the legal arguments of Clinton v. Jones or Morrison v. Olson, the two key cases that led to the scandal. Interestingly, the author does include an interview with a Supreme Court justice defending the claim in Clinton v. Jones that allowing a private lawsuit against a sitting president would be unlikely to be distracting. Although the author suggests at one point that Justice Scalia supported the independent counsel, it would have been interesting to note that Scalia was the lone dissent in Morrison v. Olson, the case authorizing the law. Indeed, Scalia predicted, in his dissent in Morrison v. Olson, that the independent counsel law would gravely damage the republic because it violated the separation of powers. \n \n The writing itself is excellent. It\'s clear, well-paced, and hard to put down. Still, there were some issues in the way of copy editing. On pages 88 and 554 the author misuses "bold-faced" in the phrases "bold-faced liar" and "bold-faced deception". Even if this unfortunate usage has been sanctioned by popularity, it\'s still better to use "bald-faced" instead. The author similarly misuses "fulsome" to mean "full" on pages 135 and 567 ("draft a more fulsome four-count complaint"; "Starr had taken in compiling a fulsome report."). \n \n Some readers may find that portions of the book take a more supportive view of the independent counsel than the narrative suggests, but since the narrative contains the facts for the reader, the treatment cannot be said to be unfair.\n \n In conclusion the book is well-written, well-researched and interesting. It\'s a superb example of journalism and an important contribution to the literature.\n'

aS'\nBetter than both "Seven" and "Natural Born Killers", director Matthew Bright\'s "Freeway" is a looseleaf modern view of Red Riding Hood where Reese Witherspoon plays Red traveling to Grandma\'s house.\n \n Only she takes this trip after her prostitute mother and junkie stepdad are arrested, she escapes the cluthces of foster care, she says goodbye to her fiancee who is then murdered in a driveby shooting, she hitches a ride with a psycho who turns out to be a mass murderer, she kills a few people, ends up in lockup, escapes, finally makes it to Gradma\'s house, where some more bloody action takes place.\n \n Oh yes, she has homosexual and heterosexual sex, spends a lot of time saying the "F" word, brutalizes most anyone that gets in her way, and otherwise creates mayhem for everybody. Sounds like your typical Reese Witherspoon role, eh? No, not by a long shot.\n \n But one thing about her role -- she is fantastic, out of this world great. She is twice the actress in this role she was playing June Carter Cash, for which she won an Oscar as best actress. On the basis of these roles, Witherspoon must be considered one of the best actresses extant right now.\n \n As the description here and on Amazon indicates, this movie presses the envelope of the "R" rating as far as possible without slipping over into NC-17. There is gory, bloody violence throughout this film, nudity and more "F" and "F"ing talk than you heard by Matt Damon when he played that low-class genius at Harvard. Someone told me they said "F" 147 times in that movie. Witherspoon herself must say it that many times here.\n \n But none of this diminishes the astonishing electricity and action that swallows the viewer right from the opening scene, where junkie-hooker mom gets arrested and weirdo-junkie stepdad forces Reese to do the nasty while mom\'s out earning a living. There is an uncompromising level of reality in these characterization, too, although it\'s clearly an over the top psycho young Sutherland plays.\n \n In an astonishing bit of casting, squeeky clean prom queen type Brooke Shields is cast as the uptight, upscale wife to lurid pervent and child molester Sutherland, whose character is even more disgusting than Witherspoon\'s. While everyone wants Sutherland rubbed out, Witherspoon manages to keep viewer sympathy because of for her terrible place in life even throughout her ongoing antisocial activities. Other players, incluidng Dan Hedaya as a cop with sympathies all over the place, contribute a lot to this film.\n \n This is recommended for viewers unafraid to look inside the dark side of our culture where youngsters like the one Witherspoon plays actually exist. There is nothing pretty or orderly about this movie; much of it seems upside down. But it is unrelentingly exciting and is full of action in almost every scene, action you may never have seen in a film before.\n \n'

aS'\nThere is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village. \n \n Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, "Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?" \n \n Sound depressing? It\'s not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one\'s heart, rather than one\'s head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off. \n \n Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That\'s the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place. \n \n Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher\'s daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended. \n \n'

I talked her into using this Acacia Tummy Fiber, and now that she uses it faithfully she rarely has an attack of IBS.  We used to buy it direct from Heather's IBS, but Amazon has a better price!\n"

aS"\nI give it 5 stars just for the simple fact that it does what it claims. If you use this as directed, you'll be very suprised. It's a little messy, I had to do 2 applications, took about a day and a half til I could go 'bandaid-less' without the paste. 1 actually came off yesterday (started the whole process 4 days ago) and the others definitely look like they are going to soon. It is a little painful & itchy (not to mention gross) but nothing awful. Those small round bandaids are perfect for this. I'll update this once they start to heal (the one that came off kind of looks like a little burn wound right now) and maybe I'll have during/after photos then. Also, it didn't really affect the healthy skin around it very much, and I know I wasn't very careful about applying it. Overall, it's worth the money. Careful about putting this in a place where others can see, it'll take a bit to heal and it turns the spot BLACK until it falls off. Wanted to also say the customer service is GREAT, the guy was super quick to reply to my emails and very nice/professional. I'll update in a few weeks!\n \n update 3/27: All gone but a few holes/divots are left behind, not healed yet though and still red. Using neosporin and bandaids 24/7.\n \n update 4/6: Divots have filled in, looking SO much better, just a bit red and discolored. Just started using prefer on scar treatment.\n \n update 5/26: about half of the moles are starting to grow back (although smaller and flat). others are scars that lighten every week but still quite noticeable. will reapply to the ones reappearing.\n"

aS"\nThis book spans Hillary Clinton's entire life up to her election to the senate as a representative from New York.It is packed full of information and is very educational. Her writing style is excellent as is her sense of humour. \n Mention is made of her parents and grandparents and her meeting with Bill Clinton. She speaks extensively of her life in the white house. Jackie Kennedy was an invaluable source of wisdon, advice and support to her at this time.She speaks in great detail of the opposition to health care, which was very well financed. She does not hesitate to expose her enemies. She has traveled frequently and extensively and scorns those members of congress who proundly announce they have never traveled outside the country. She feels that instead of being insular and uninformed Americans benefit from learning more about the world in which we live. Right on! I say. But she doesn't just visit an incredible number of countries,she is aware of the issues being dealt with in those places and in many instances has formed great ties with the people.\n When the s--- hit the fan with Bill and Monica Lewinsky, Hillary does not shy away from it. It took her a while and good counseling to decide whether to fight for her husband and marriage but she resolved to fight for her president.\n I think this book is a great campaign startegy for the presidency. She mentions her interest in guarding the social safety net. Her vast experience is impressive. Last but not least credit must be given to both Hillary and Bill for the raising of a well adjusted, independent and intelligent daughter. Bravo!\n"

aS'\nLike others, I have been waiting for this game to be released since last year.  We have a Wii but my main platform choice is DS.  \n \n I have to say this Lego game is pretty good now that I have played it for a few days.  My only real complaint is that unlike the previous Lego DS games you CANNOT use the buttons on the right to perform any of the spells like you could in the Lego Star Wars and Indiana Jones games to perform stunts, punch, etc.  For this game you must use the stylus because of how the "spells" are performed. I found it a little annoying at first, but now it seems completely natural.\n \n And since you need the stylus out to do any of the spells you find it is easier to "guide" Harry or whoever around the game instead of using the directional keys to walk your character around like in the previous games.  I can see this being where the dizzy feeling can occur until you get used it.  \n \n I also agree about the sensitivity in using the stylus and either changing characters or doing the spinning stun thing in error time after time.  \n \n \n'

aS'\nAs caveats, I would describe my beard density as significantly below average and I have fairly sensitive skin.  I have generally shaved with a double bladed razor in the past, but I have had problems with irritation of my neck.

I have taken to keeping one at work and another in my gym bag.\n'

aS"\nOk, there seems to be some confusion as to what this product will do over the mini-dvi to VGA adapter that Apple sells, so I hope I can shed some light on the matter. The mini-dvi to VGA allows you to display your computer monitor on your television screen with resolutions that your COMPUTER MONITOR is capable of. This is very limiting as most TVs will not support the higher resolutions of the monitor, leaving you with little better than 800x600. In comes the mini-dvi to HDMI adapter, which allows you to display your computer monitor on your television, but the real magic is in the resolutions you are now given. The resolutions are HDTV compatible, allowing for HD viewing( I view mine in 720p). If you're looking for a quick answer, this product is much better than any mini-dvi to VGA that is out, simply for the fact that your resolution will be higher on the TV, resulting in a clearer picture and much more readable text.\n"

aS'\nUsing an HDMI to DVI cable for video, and an RCA jack to stereo 1/8th inch jack for sound, this monitor plus my Time Warner HD cable box is now serving as a low cost 22" HDTV. While it would be nice to be able to change the sound volume using a remote (and I imagine I could if I ran the sound out from the set-top box through a stereo system or home theatre system), this is a perfectly acceptable solution for the competitively low price.\n \n Kudos to Amazon for getting this to me well ahead of schedule. Everything arrived well packaged and in excellent condition.\n \n The ViewSonic box included power cord, installation CD (for computer, not needed for my use), a VGA cable and brief instructions.\n'

aS"\nI purchased Sham Wow from QVC after watching QVC's presentation.  The gentleman presenting Sham Wow stated that the Sham Wow should be DAMPENED prior to use and if it is being used to pick up severe spills on rugs etc, one should dilute the spill prior to using Sham Wow.\n \n I read these reviews after I purchased and decided to do my own test.  I used the kitchen shamwow to clean my George Foreman grill.  I do not have the removable grill plates.  So one can imagine the mess from grilling chicken.  Sham Wow cleaned the grill plates perfectly. \n It would take 3 or more paper towels to do the job.\n \n In addition I use cold water wash.  The Sham Wow did not shrink and it came out clean.  It was stained and I really did not believe that it would come out clean.\n \n So Sham Wow did work for me.  Granted, thankfully I have not had any spills on carpets to clean up yet but if and when I do I will dampen the Sham Wow before use and dilute the spill.  Hopefully it will work\n"

aS'\nAfter looking for a small, white, kitchen TV in all the stores, and finding nothing at all that would be appropriate, I found this one on-line. After reading the mostly good reviews written for it (both the black version as well as this in white), I decided to take a chance and order it without first seeing it "in person." It arrived within two days, and it was terrifically simple to set up. I have obviously been living in the dark ages with the small 9" kitchen TV it replaced. It\'s a perfect size for the table top, the color and sound are superior to the old one, the various features and options are fabulous to now have in the kitchen -- a variety of picture sizes, shapes, and modes (yes, "movie" seems the best) and even the DVD option will be useful too I bet. I like the wide screen and size in general for this small spot, and it should all look even better when they switch everything over to digital within the month and I get my adapter box. I agree, there is a few second\'s delay when switching channels, but that seems to be the only fault I can find and it\'s pretty minor to me. The red light is no problem at all and a tiny light in the kitchen at night isn\'t a bad thing! This has been a really pleasant surprise!\n'

aS'\nThe Optoma EP727 projector was much smaller than we expected, and very lightweight, but it didn\'t feel flimsy at all, just solid and well-built.\n \n We bought this to use for a theatre show. The set largely consisted of slides projected onto a backdrop, and we were worried about having the slides bright and sharp, despite the long throw and the bright stage lights illuminating the actors. No trouble - this was great! We fastened the projector up on the lighting bar, and strung a 50\' VGA cable up, over, and down to the controlling computer (an old G3 Apple iBook). It worked flawlessly. We were not certain the remote would work from that distance (the projector was 20\' in the air) but we had no problem turning the machine on and off remotely. The keystoning feature was very useful, since we were projecting from well above the stage. \n \n The projector had no trouble with long \'on\' times. It was on continuously for about 5 hours during the dress rehersal, and for about 2 hours for each performance. I was really impressed when it recovered without a hiccup when we triggered a circuit breaker and the power went out. That happened twice; once during rehersal and once during a performance. \n \n In fact, the only complaint I have at all is that the projector boots while projecting the name "Optoma", then hunts for the computer signal. If it weren\'t for that, I\'m sure the audience would not have noticed when the circuit blew during the performance (it was during a transition in the play, and a blackout might have been appropriate). As it was, it only took a minute or so to get fully operational again. \n \n We did not use the DVI input for this show, but I tried it with my home computer (which has a DVI video out) and the projector image looked especially sharp. \n \n Basically, I love it.\n \n \n \n'

aS"\nI really liked PuzzleQuest: Challange of the Warlords on Xbox Live Arcade, so when I got my new DSi, I bought PuzzleQuest: Galactrix to go with the system. It is a lot like the original, except in space. You mine for substances, and upgrade your spaceship, instead of improving your mount. Instead of magic, you have lasers and shields. Although, there are some psychic powers. \n \n All-in-all the new board with the multiple angles is more challenging, and the 'jump-gate' hacking can get tense because of the time limits. I think this is a good upgrade to a great game, and it will probably chew up a similar amount of my free time as the original.\n"

aS'\nOne can pay $300 or more for these compression leg massagers, so this one is reasonably priced.  It is probably on the primitive side for these items - you can press up or down for the length of time, but you only figure out what this means through trial and error.  More expensive models have timers, while this one does not.  But it does inflate the chambers that go around your legs, so from that perspective it is perfectly adequate.\n'

aS"\nThis product is fantastic!  If you're looking for a personal die cut system I wouldn't bother with anything else on the market right now.  It is compact when closed, so it won't take up unnecessary table space.  It is also very light and has a comfortable handle for travelling.\n \n Yes, it is a bit of an investment, but it is honestly a better deal than many of the cheaper systems out there.  It can cut each shape in 11 sizes from 1 inch to 5.5 inches.  Most cartridges are around $90; compare that to quickutz & sizzix alphabets which retail for $150, can only cut one size, and take up a lot more storage space.\n \n Blades are easy to replace and the cutting mats seem to last longer than cricut suggests.  You'll get more life out of them by rotating the mat each time you cut and also storing it with the plastic sheet to keep dust from accumulating on the sticky surface.\n \n I've heard of people having difficulty cutting thicker cardstock with this machine, but we have been able to cut bazzil easily by setting the blade depth to 6 and the speed & pressure to their max settings.\n \n I've used both the Cricut and Xyron Personal Cutting System extensively and would recommend the Cricut.\n"

aS"\nBack home in Scotland I ate haggis at least twice a week and it's been a major craving for the 8 months I've lived in the US. This isn't that similar to tinned haggis in Scotland; mainly the texture of tinned haggis back home is finer and drier than this...but it is fairly close to the 'real' haggis in a skin and is spiced just perfectly. I think preparation counts for a lot with this haggis and I dry fry it in a pan whilst stirring it until it just starts to brown as I think that improves the texture. All in all it's great with a baked potato or just for fellow Scots missing a taste of home. If you haven't tried haggis then this is a great example of how good it is...and it really is like nothing else!\n"

aS'\nI really like the reviews that say "my motorcycle safety class guy said that the best gloves have seams on the outside."  Guess what?  These are not the best gloves money can buy.  They are cheap and effective.\n Same thing about not being able to pick up a quarter off the ground.  That takes me a couple tries with my bare hands.\n If you want gloves that are by themselves comfortable at all times and in all weather, really durable, maximum protection, dexterity feels better than your bare hands, etc., then you\'re gonna have to spend $300.00.  (btw, if you own $300 gloves and aren\'t some kind of professional racer or a retired millionaire out with your wife on a six month Goldwing tour of the US, you\'re just a sucker.  And if you are one of those two, you\'re awesome).\n I do apreciate the comments about them running small.  I got one size up from my usual and they\'re just a little big.  Really they\'re just perfect b/c I like to put a pair of $1 knit gloves underneath for weather versatility during the day.\n The gloves were a little itchy when I first wore them (without my 2nd pair), but that quickly wore off.  With the gloves under, they\'re SUPER comfortable.  The grip is perfect.  Also love the big knuckle pads.  I get hit with more rocks to my hands than you would believe.\n All-in-all, for $15 this is a great pair of gloves.\n'

aS'\nTwo weeks ago, I needed a new coffee maker.  The Krups Aroma Control maker is in all the stores and catalogs, so I bought one in the local mall BEFORE reading the Amazon reviews.  BIG MISTAKE.  Lesson learned - read the reviews - many negative comments.  I used it for 3 days, and readily understood the description (...) of "eye candy" (looks nice, but seems like cheap plastic) and weak coffee (what they describe as a feature - allowing the coffee to steep - is really a euphemism for a poorly designed system that is guaranteed to give you a weak cup of coffee).  One redeeming feature - the carafe is very nice. Within 2 days of having the Krups, i was on Amazon looking for a replacement coffee maker (a good cup of coffee is critical in the morning!).  I went out on the risk curve and ordered the new Cuisinart - no reviews yet.  The Cuisinart has a more classic brewing system (water goes through grinds via gravity), yields a delicious cup of HOT coffee, has a variable temperature hot place, and looks and feels solid.  We happen to have stainless steel appliances (refrigerator, freezer, stove), and it matches beautifully.  Best news - excellent coffee!.  I would highly recommend the Cuisinart.\n'

aS"\nAfter having devoured The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)  I was very much looking forward to The Girl Who Played With Fire. But somehow the story did not captivate me as much as the first Lisbeth Salander / Mikael Blomkvist book. And here are my main points of criticism:\n \n 1. There is no direct interaction between Lisbeth and Mikael in this story. They are connected by the events, yes, but the unique relationship that had begun to develop between them in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was not continued here, and for me this was a key element and one of the main reasons I was so fascinated with the characters. With every page I turned (and there are many!), I was hoping to see them come together again, alas it only happened at the very end of the book and even then there was no communication between the two.\n \n 2. The storyline - to me - was much less believable than in the first book. There are a few (for lack of a better word) improbabilities here that almost ruined it for me. Especially the scene towards the end, where Lisbeth is confronted with her brother and her father and their unspeakable act against her (I don't want to give anything away, so no details but you will know what I mean when you get to it). The coherence I so admired in the first book was just not that well executed in The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage) .\n \n 3. The end came extremely abruptly. I actually went online after finishing it to make sure that I hadn't somehow received an issue with some of the pages missing. I just couldn't believe that this book with several hundred pages and tons of details given on those would simply end like this. But it did and left me shaking my head a bit.\n \n In summary, this is not a bad thriller but it did not reach the masterful craftsmanship and effortlessness that made the first book an absolute standout in the ocean of thrillers on the market.\n \n \n"

aS"\nThis watch, like most if not all chronograph models offered by Citizen, is more designed for style than function.  The 60 minute dial at 10:00 is too small to adequately time anything over a minute and the hand moves in a sweep rather than clicking fashion, which further confuses the user.  I'm surprised that Citizen even put his series on the market.  Check out the two Swiss Army watch companies and you'll notice they have a 30 minute dial and the hand clicks from one minute to the next.  If you want an Eco-Drive watch save the money and get the plain watch, if you want a chronograph buy another brand.  I have used chronographs for work, recreation, and pleasure for over 20 years and have used several brands and this one is by far the hardest to read and consequently in my opinion is not functional when accurately timing an event is important.\n"

aS'\nPublished in 1847, WUTHERING HEIGHTS was not well received by the reading public, many of whom condemned it as sordid, vulgar, and unnatural--and author Emily Bronte went to her grave in 1848 believing that her only novel was a failure.  It was not until 1850, when WUTHERING HEIGHTS received a second printing with an introduction by Emily\'s sister Charlotte, that it attracted a wide readership.  And from that point the reputation of the book has never looked back.  Today it is widely recognized as one of the great novels of English literature.\n \n Even so, WUTHERING HEIGHTS continues to divide readers.  It is not a pretty love story; rather, it is swirling tale of largely unlikeable people caught up in obsessive love that turns to dark madness.  It is cruel, violent, dark and brooding, and many people find it extremely unpleasant.  And yet--it possesses a grandeur of language and design, a sense of tremendous pity and great loss that sets it apart from virtually every other novel written.\n \n The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback.  After a visit to his strange landlord, a newcomer to the area desires to know the history of the family--which he receives from Nelly Deans, a servant who introduces us to the Earnshaw family who once resided in the house known as Wuthering Heights.  It was once a cheerful place, but Old Earnshaw adopted a "Gipsy" child who he named Heathcliff.  And Catherine, daughter of the house, found in him the perfect companion: wild, rude, and as proud and cruel as she.  But although Catherine loves him, even recognizes him as her soulmate, she cannot lower herself to marry so far below her social station.  She instead marries another, and in so doing sets in motion an obsession that will destroy them all.\n \n WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a bit difficult to "get into;" the opening chapters are so dark in their portrait of the end result of this obsessive love that they are somewhat off-putting.  But they feed into the flow of the work in a remarkable way, setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature, a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations.  Catherine and Heathcliff are equally remarkable, both vicious and cruel, and yet never able to shed their impossible love no matter how brutally one may wound the other.\n \n As the novel coils further into alcoholism, seduction, and one of the most elaborately imagined plans of revenge it gathers into a ghostly tone: Heathcliff, driven to madness by a woman who is not there but who seems reflected in every part of his world--dragging her corpse from the grave, hearing her calling to him from the moors, escalating his brutality not for the sake of brutality but so that her memory will never fade, so that she may never leave his mind until death itself.  Yes, this is madness, insanity, and there is no peace this side of the grave or even beyond.\n \n It is a stunning novel, frightening, inexorable, unsettling, filled with unbridled passion that makes one cringe.  Even if you do not like it, you should read it at least once--and those who do like it will return to it again and again.\n \n GFT, Amazon Reviewer\n'

aS"\nThis is my first iPod Touch and I'm enjoying every minute of it.  I previously had a iPod Nano 3rd Gen, but broke it at the gym, actually I smashed it on one of the machines.  I was debating about getting a nano or an iTouch, but I'm glad I chose the Touch.  The bad, would be no camera, battery doesn't last that long, and you require a wireless connection for some of the features.  The good, would be the buit in Wi-Fi, the tons of free apps, the easy to use interface. I recommend the 32GB or 64GB over the 8GB, the 8GB is really a 2nd Gen, not that fast when it comes to games, I got the 32GB and I can see a difference.\n"

aS"\nI've read some of the other reviews concerning this printer discussing noise, print time and paper handling.  Well, here's me take.  I have had the printer for over a month now.  The printer is far quieter than the Photosmart 7550 I had before (it sounded like two monkies with hammers were working inside). The 8000 is very quiet to me.  I use a PC with the XP op system and it takes a total of 30 seconds to print anything I've printed so far.  It usually takes 12 to 14 seconds to initiallize and around 15 to 18 seconds to print the page - whether all text or partial graphics.  I've not had any paper handling issues either - though I do just use HP All Purpose paper.  I haven't tried unusual paper types.  Bottom line: if you just want a printer you can count on for everyday stuff then this is the one.\n"

If you get sick of the speakers that come with the system you can easily switch the speaker setting to "large" and upgrade your speakers as you see fit.

The controls and plugs are easily accessible and easy to use.  They are very well designed and to my tastes attractive while on display.  They fold up into a little cube for packing. I have wanted an easy way to listen to my iPod Nano while doing other things, like working on my bonsai collection in the garden. Earphones are a pain unless I am driving.  I tried to stream podcasts from my netbook, but the built in speakers were woefully weak, and the form factor was a pain to have to move around.  I\'m ordering two more.  They are well built and can plug into any "headphone" output of desktop, laptop, netbook, iPod.  I have one desktop computer without speakers. Now I can have this little unit plugged in for audio and power to the desktop with it perfectly nestled under the LCD, and listen to stuff that I had to use earphones for previously.  You see, I already have two sets of speakers connected to other computers in the same work area for high quality sound should I ever need it.  Music even sounds great on these little speakers.  Get some while you can!\n'

aS"\nThough I do not follow golf, it was hard not pay attention to Tiger. Naturally, I was left shaking my head with everyone else, wondering what drove someone so disciplined to make such a mess of his life. Steve Helling's book answers some of those questions, though it would be impossible to answer all of them. It is not a book of sensationalism or speculation, but well-written journalism that give us an inside look at both the life and the downfall of a paragon who never asked to be placed on the pedestal on which the world displayed him.\n \n This book follows the clues that tell us some of what makes Tiger Woods who he is, starting with the breadcrumbs that were dropped long before his birth. While a bemused public looked on as a toddler putted against Bob Hope, not one of them could have predicted that that same child would grow to be not only the world's greatest golfer, but also a hero and role model with such a carefully constructed persona that even his handlers would forget that a real person lay behind the smoke and mirrors. Tiger Woods was not a god, but an unforgiving public would punish him for not acting like one.\n \n While he is responsible for his mistakes, one can't help but wonder who Tiger would have been had he been allowed to be Tiger Woods rather than a meticulously crafted ideal. \n \n \n \n \n"

aS'\nThis subwoofer puts out plenty of deep tight natural sounding bass, not "boomy" bass. It sounds great! I am using a Harmon Kardon 3380 receiver and 2 Klipsch SB-1 bookshelf speakers, and this sub in a 12x20 room and it fills the room with sound.I listen to mostly jazz and classical, with some new-age thrown in. On ocassion though I pop in Sound Garden or Metallica too. I find that I have to adjust the bass output down quite abit when rockin\' out, or the bass is overwhelming.There is no auto on feature on this sub, but I have it plugged into a switched outlet on the receiver, so it goes off and on with it.Overall, I recommend it highly.\n'

aS'\nI have been enjoying Fallout 3 for about 70 hours now and I am having as much fun now as I was 50 hours ago, which is to say A LOT.\n \n I cannot speak to the bugs that others seem to be experiencing. In my 70 hours I have had my game freeze only a handful of times, and none of them were anything that was game breaking. I have several friends who are also playing and none of them have expressed any serious glitches either.\n \n I have played both the previous Fallout games and vastly enjoyed them both, so to make a blanket statement that "anyone who was a fan of the first 2 Fallouts will hate this game" is just erroneous. I would agree with someone who said this game is more of a Next Gen title in the Fallout Universe rather than a true sequel to the Interplay games. \n \n However, that does not in any way detract from the epic amount of fun to be found in Fallout 3. \n \n The adventuring around the Wastes is the highlight of the game to be sure. The amazing amount of freedom to roam the Wastes is just phenomenal, so much so that once you do decide to progress the Main Story it can seem very limiting and cramped at times, especially when crawling around through the DC Ruins and all the subway tunnels required to get to  the Main Mall. \n \n However, compared to the vast scope and size of the experience, this is a minor complaint and really a very short and small portion of the game. It should only take maybe 5 hours to explore it all and finish up some questing, then you can Fast Travel back whenever you want and get back to tearing it up in the Wastes. \n \n Combat is quality, but it is NOT a Shooter. People expecting Shooter mechanics will be disappointed, as even point blank shooting still utilizes an in game Dice Roll to determine whether you hit and how much damage you do etc. \n \n It is likely that people complaining about Ammo or clunky targeting are unaware of this game mechanic, but it is what makes the game an RPG, not a Shooter. There is ample amounts of Ammo (I have never run out in 70 hours of gameplay and I have killed over 1000 living -isms according to my in game stat sheet), but it is not unlimited like a Shooter. \n \n The VATS mode is a good way to illustrate the difference. You queue up VATS and it will give you a stop-time targeting system. Within this system, you will be given percentages to hit on various Body parts: 87% to hit the head, 95% to hit the Body etc. However, these percentages are also indicative of how much of a chance you would have to hit those body parts OUT of VATS as well. So if you have a 50% chance to hit a leg in VATS, you have that SAME chance to hit in real-time it just does not illustrate it anywhere. SO even if your targeting arrow is Red, you still only have the same percentage to hit as you would in VATS. Which is to say you will miss and waste a ton of ammo if you just think "my target is red I can unload a clip". \n \n Dice Rolls are a staple of RPGS, Oblivion had them, it was just not as noticeable because you were using Melee weapons, but every time your guy reared back to swing it rolled the dice to see if you would hit, how much of a damaging blow it would be etc.\n \n The game has a wide array of voice acting, some is great, some not so much. The story has its ups and downs, but is good enough to not take away from the overall (it certainly helps that the great Liam Neeson is the Vault Dweller\'s Father, he is an example of the Great voice acting). Various mini-quests are actually more entertaining and interesting than the main story, so there is definitely enough Good story in the game to keep it interesting. \n \n However, the game\'s strength is in solo-adventuring IMO. While you can get sidekicks and helpers, the real fun is being a Hero of the Wastes and taking down Super-Mutants, Raiders, Slavers and Death Claws all by your lonesome as you scour the Wastes in search of unique weapons, caps, ammo and mini-quests littered throughout. \n \n Overall, I would rate the game a 9/10 and consider it the only game on Xbox 360 that gives Mass Effect a challenge for best title.\n'

aS'\n"Oh my God! He\'s so hot when he\'s wet!" was the first thing I heard from the squealing 13 year old girl seated next to me as this movie started in the theater, and yes, Percy Jackson (the son of Poseidon) was frequently wet throughout this movie.  I also heard other variations on this exclamation, ranging from "He\'s so hot when he sweats" to "He\'s even hot when he bleeds!" and although I agreed wholeheartedly with the young lady to my left, this movie has a lot more going for it than the fantastic eye candy that is Logan Lerman.\n \n The movie is a great adventure filled with plenty of suspense and cleaver and funny dialogue.  It also includes one of my favorite scenes in a movie released within the last five years, which I will only describe with the words "Poker Face" so as not to spoil it for any new viewers.  \n \n Yes, there are a several over-the-top or wooden performances from a few of the adult actors (Pierce Brosnan, coming off as more of a creepy child molester than the Dumbledore-like figure of wisdom and guidance he hopes to be) but the young actors playing Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Luke were fantastic in their roles.  \n \n This movie was so much fun; I wound up seeing it 4 times in the theater with a friend of mine who also fell in love with it.  I had never read the books before, but I am grateful to this movie for inspiring me to read the Percy Jackson series, which is better quality than the film.  However, as far as entertainment value goes, you can\'t beat this movie.\n \n'

aS"\nI have a recurring Morton's Neuroma in my foot, for which I've had surgery.  When it flared up again, I knew I needed a foot support, and I purchased a pair of these gel insoles at Amazon.  I couldn't believe the relief!\n \n These insoles treat your feet like babies.  They cushion the foot and raise the arch, and in doing so, they relieve the pain located behind the toes. They also provide relief for the whole foot.  If you stand all day at work or at home, and your feet get tired, you may find relief with this product.  After I used them, I purchased several pair for my brother, who is on his feet all day.  He said that his feet have never felt so good and that he no longer gets tired feet at work.\n \n I have been wearing a pair of these for a year. I am not on my feet a lot, but the inserts have lasted all this time!  Just because they have gel in them doesn't mean they'll wear out tomorrow.  \n \n If your experience is like mine, I urge you to try a pair of these insoles.  I think you'll be glad you did.\n"

aS'\nEver since getting the iPod Touch, I\'ve had an extreme case of iPhone envy; the Touch\'s intuitive interface, sleek design, and overall pleasant experience made me wish I could use it on the go, and not be tied down to Wi-Fi networks. As a happy Verizon customer, however, I was not going to switch providers just to get a new phone (although the thought crossed my mind more than once!). After a long wait, I finally got my hands on an iPhone competitor, the Motorola Droid. While it might not be the "iPhone Killer" that people have claimed it to be, it\'s a great phone in its own right.\n \n CALL QUALITY\n For some reason, I get fewer service bars/seemingly weaker reception compared to my LG Dare. In the same spot, holding both phones, I get 5 bars on my Dare (which I\'ve since given ), while I only get 2 bars on my Droid. Weird, but fortunately I haven\'t actually noticed any decline in call quality or reliability; it\'s been superb!\n \n SPEAKER\n Loud, and good quality! This is important, because whether you\'re listening for driving directions using the built-in GPS, streaming music through Pandora, or talking, the speaker is very loud and clear.\n \n BATTERY LIFE\n Decent. Yes, the battery can run out quickly, but that\'s just because you\'ll find yourself using the phone so much! Some of the biggest battery drainers I\'ve noticed have been screen brightness, GPS, and streaming radio. These problems can be resolved by turning down screen brightness (even at its lowest setting, still bright and crisp), turning off the GPS when it\'s not in use (through the Power Control widget), and not relying exclusively on streaming radio for music (with the included 16GB card you can store plenty!)\n \n DISPLAY\n Gorgeous, crisp, and very bright display that makes other phones pale in comparison. I love it, and highly recommend those considering this phone to take a look at one in their local Verizon store. Even at its darkest setting, its very good. The high-resolution display also allows for text to appear much more detailed and crisp, a plus for those with glasses.\n \n CAMERA\n The Droid packs a 5 Megapixel camera, as well as video-recording at roughly DVD-quality. The camera is a bit slow to auto-focus, but pictures come out fine. Not great, but decent for a cell phone, especially at night using the flash. While its still pictures don\'t come out great, the Droid\'s videos come out really well. The audio recorded on videos is also really good.\n \n LOOK AND FEEL\n The phone isn\'t light, but it also isn\'t as heavy as I feared based on initial reviews. The only criticism is that there are no dedicated call/end buttons...instead, you have to rely on the phone application, which means you can\'t feel around for the call/end buttons, say you get a phone call in the middle of the night. Still, that\'s just a minor gripe. The phone feels sturdy, not cheap, and is pretty slim considering it packs a full slide-out QWERTY keyboard.\n \n KEYBOARD\n One of the major selling points of this phone was that it has a physical keyboard. The keyboard isn\'t perfect - keys are shallow, too close to one another, and there isn\'t a dedicated row for numbers. Also, the top row of keys is inconveniently located too high to the top of the phone. Still, despite these shortcomings, I would not use this phone without the physical keyboard. After a year with the touchscreen-only LG Dare, I still had difficulty with typing, and even after 2 years with an iPod Touch - which has a much better touchscreen keyboard than the Dare - I have difficulty with typing on that, as well. While the touchscreen keyboard on the Droid is very good, I still make many fewer mistakes with the physical keyboard than with the touchscreen one. While I\'d say this is largely a matter of personal preference, I\'d like to emphasize that the physical keyboard isn\'t nearly as bad as some reviewers online made it out to be.\n \n Android Market\n As it stands now, the Android Market has over 10,000 apps, while the Apple App store has over 100,000. As a result, some reviewers have said - wrongly, I believe - that the Droid is somehow more limited. One should remember that while the iPhone/Touch had a headstart in developing its application market, many new developers have flocked to Android as more phones have come to market. There already is a strong selection of apps, and this will only grow over time.\n \n SHORTCOMINGS\n The two major shortcomings of this phone - especially when compared to the iPhone - are that:\n 1. Not as intuitive as the iPhone. I think this phone is great for many users, but others might find it to be a little complicated. This phone is very capable, but sometimes to find things you have to dig around a bit more than might be convenient (I don\'t mind this too much).\n 2. No widespread and easily available alternative to iTunes. I use DoubleTwist, but without a doubt iTunes is a much easier way to transfer media to the phone than dragging and dropping or using iTunes alternatives, for most people at least. While I don\'t buy MP3s online, others have also pointed to the iTunes store offering much more selection than Amazon\'s MP3 store.\n \n CONCLUSIONS\n Who should get this phone? If this is your first smartphone, you might find things to be a little difficult at first, but well worth the patience. While this phone isn\'t for everybody, if you are already on/hope to switch to Verizon, this is without a doubt one of the strongest offerings. I don\'t know if I would necessarily dump my iPhone if I were an AT&T Customer, but I think that this phone will be a very useful tool for many people who have considered an iPhone but wanted a physical keyboard, more customizability, or more Google integration. While there are a few shortcomings in design and media integration, I can now say I\'ve found the cure to my iPhone envy!\n \n \n **UPDATE 2.22.10** \n I wanted to say that while I\'m still very happy with my Droid, one problem has arisen. For some reason, text messages I compose are not always going through...after minutes of trying, the phone simply notifies me saying that the text message was not sent. I have no clue why this is happening, but must say it is a bit frustrating. Fortunately, it doesn\'t happen too often, but it has happened enough to notice. This has happened to text messages I\'ve sent to people on different carriers, so I\'m assuming the problem is from my end on not the recipients\'. Either way, a small price to pay for an otherwise amazing phone.\n'

aS"\nI've only watched the blu-ray version twice, but it is really incredible.  I have never seen any HD to compare with this one.  The movie itself is a work of art, with an incredible level of creativity and beautiful design/ornamentation to stretch anyone's imagination.  The 3-D effect, through parallax (humans perceive 3-D by both binocular vision, for near objects, and parallax, for more distant objects)is the best I have seen.  The theme is also highly relevant to our times.  The expressivity of the actors is beyond comparison, certainly real, and enhanced by the technology used to produce this.  I really look forward to an expanded version of this blu-ray in the future, if one is forthcoming.  I have heard a popular story line related to the lack of an original story or character development in this, and it is just gibberish.  I can see how the film would be viewed as a threat to traditional Hollywood filmmaking, however.  I have seen 'Hurt Locker' that won the Academy Award for best picture, and it is a good film.  The single theme and unidimensional character of that movie was simply this:  obsession with dangerous work.  In contrast, Avatar has a great deal to say about native cultures that are close to nature (e.g., stone age cultures) in general, exploitation of resources by technology-driven societies, and the mystery of life itself.  It will make you think about the mystery of incarnation.  This is a deeply thoughtful production, a fact that should not be missed as you follow the carefully written action/adventure story line.  The theme, and the artwork, bear a signature that is unique in the history of filmmaking.  Also, if you don't already have a blu-ray, DVD-upconvert player, this is the best reason to get one now.\n"

aS"\nThis was the third monitor I bought for our second child.  Don't waste your time trying the least expensive ones like I did, this one is worth the money.  I have the Super Clear Double Receiver by Safety 1st in my 2 year old's room, which works perfect.  I needed a second one for my newborn.  I tried another Safety 1st, and even with 2 channels, I could only pick up sound from one room.  Then I returned it for a Sound N Lights monitor by Fisher-Price.  Bigger mistake, we couldn't hear any room, only major static.  Finally we tried this one and love it!!!  It is so quiet, except, of course, when your baby makes noise.  I can't believe how many channel options it has, and other features too, like an alarm when you are almost out of range.  Also, a rechargable battery, that charges when plugged in, so you don't have to waste your own batteries when wanting to use it outside.  Go for the Gold, this Sony is the best yet.\n"

aS"\nVery happy to see the Enviro Steamer return !!!  I have had the 311A enviro steamer for 2 years.  I had to  pay an arm & a leg for it on ebay because Eureka discontinued this product several years ago.  Mopping was my least favorite chore, it almost brought me to tears I hated it so much.  I have over 1200 sq.ft. of tile in my house & keeping it clean used to be a daunting task.   UNTIL........the enviro steamer.\n \n One of the best purchases I have ever made.  No more bucket & mop,  no more over perfumed wet jet that leaves you with a sticky floor & expensive replacement pads & fluids.  Now it is just water, the enviro steamer, a washable & reusable magic pad & me.  I actually consider cleaning my floors FUN now.  By the way.....men love using the enviro steamer, you may even find your husband cleaning the floors more often. \n \n Hint:  Get a few extra Magic pads, 1 or 2 is not enough unless you have only 1 small area to clean.  After I finish with 1 room, I just slap a new pad on, refill the water, give the enviro steamer a few minutes to heat back up & I'm on to the next room.  The first room is dry in minutes & clean.\n"

From the description of the player on the Samsung website, amazon etc, \n i got the idea that there is a lot more apps in the Samsung Apps store/section(facebook, twitter, google maps etc). \n None of them are there (yet). Even in the manual they used google maps as an example. Maybe they will add this stuff with the time.  \n \n'

aS'\nI purchased this to go with my new bike because I end up riding home late after work sometimes and in the city a light is a requirement.  But this package comes with two products.  The headlamp and a tail light.\n \n Headlamp - This thing is great.  I love the ability to switch between the Xenon bulb and the dual LEDs.  The Xenon is very bright, more than adequate for night riding.  The LEDs are a nice backup because the provide you with a nearly indispensable source of light as they use very little battery power.  But if you find yourself running low it will automatically switch to a "Take Me Home" mode that uses less power for those long treks home (or unexpected detours).  What gets me is a friend of mine purchased a much more expensive headlamp and this thing blows his out of the water.\n \n Tail Light - This is why I gave the review four stars.  This product at first seemed just as good as the headlamp.  Plenty of options (on, blink, blink faster, varied LEDs cycling, and fast cycle).  After mounting it I went to angle it down a bit and the casing came right off (the way your replace the batteries).  The casing is rather poorly made, the bottom clip doesn\'t hold so well, it could be just mine but the design seems flawed.  I had to remove it because a rough bump could easily knock it off and then it would be lost forever.  A little bit of tape on the bottom solved this problem for me so it wasn\'t a complete loss.\n \n Overall the products are nice.  The headlamp made this purchase worth it for me since I already have a backup (reserve) tail light.\n \n Best Wishes...\n'

aS'\nI just finished reading BIAS and I HIGHLY recommend it for people of all political persuasions.  A couple things to note: 1. It\'s a very engaging read -- well written and entertaining on top of infomative.   2. It\'s much more SUBSTANTIAL than I expected.  I thought it would just be an anti-liberal gossip session but it had a LOT of MEAT in it that I think would be interesting to any AMERICAN, not just a conservative one. 3. I\'ve always sensed a liberal bias in the media, but thought that was just "spin" ...reporting the PART of the news that fit their agenda.  I was sincerely shocked to learn of instances where they have FLAT OUT LIED to us. Great Book!\n'

aS"\nI've only read a couple books by Jane Green and was not impressed but this book was unbelievably good!  Granted I am nearly 9 months pregnant and have a toddler of my own but this book had me bawling.  I was so invested in the characters and what happened to each that I almost couldn't finish the book out of fear of what would happen.  Steff is your typical chick lit, flighty character and you can pretty much predict what would happen to her in the end.  Still the story was written in such a way that it will keep you engaged and hoping for a happy ending for all of the main characters.  Callie's husband at first had me guessing if he was going to go the route of the busy working husband who would turn out to be a cheater or a loving husband that would be there no matter what.\n \n The other nice thing about this book was each chapter opens up with a recipe.  Some of them sounded so tasty I may just have to try them out myself.  Really there wasn't anything I actively disliked about this story.  The only slightly negative thing I can say is much of the story is predictable but I find that true of all chick lit books.  This is definitely a must read book but have a few tissues on hand.\n"

aS"\nThere are two things I take very seriously in this life:  one is books, the other is coffee (not surprisingly, the often go together).  While the bulk of my reviews are children's books, I felt it necessary to go against type and review this coffee grinder. Most coffee experts as well as everyday, casual drinkers agree that the best tasting coffee is brewed with freshly ground beans.  Once beans are ground, they begin to oxidize, much like an opened bottle of wine.  Old preground coffee has a tendency to taste bitter, and with the proliferation of inexpensive grinders, more and more people are buying whole bean coffee to grind right before they brew. Of course, finding the RIGHT grinder for the price is the tough part.  Grinders exist in every form and size and expense bracket.  Quite a lot of round, domed grinders I've used have unsharpened blades on a mount that is too high to really grind beans fine enough for specialty coffee like espresso or Turkish.  The Krups has a few advantages over other grinders, namely these:   ** The blades are sharp and mounted low in the housing.  Maybe other manufactures are saving a few pennies by putting flat tongues of metal in their grinders, but they don't have the edge to pulverize beans like the Krups can.  ** The machine has a higher RPM than other machines.  This makes it easier to reduce grind times and with additional speed, can reduce whole beans to powder in less than a minute (I've had a Black n' Decker that couldn't grind beans for Turkish coffee if you held the button for half an hour). ** the housing is oval and the lid is flat.  I'm not an engineer or physicist, but I think the flat lid and oval shape allow the beans to fall back towards the blades for further grinding (again, my Black n' Decker allowed the beans to spin around the lid in a whirlpool pattern that was pretty to look at, but pointless for actually reducing the grounds to the small particles I wanted). **  it has a large capacity.  Do you like strong coffee??  Use more grounds, then!!  The box says that you can grind up to 20 cups of java at a time.  I don't know about the sorts of demitasses they must be using to gauge the volume of a &quot;cup&quot;, but I do know that this machine can grind up enough beans for a number of very stiff MUGS of coffee. In the disadvantages column, the only one I could site is that the housing cup is slanted down, I'm assuming for decorative purposes.  Hence, I'm forever spilling beans out of the lower side.  My new secret is to measure the beans out in the LID, first, then turn the whole thing upside down and put the housing into the lid.  Since I only use it to grind coffee (and while I drink my fair share, I don't have the thing running nonstop day and night), I can't speak with any aplomb about how sturdy a machine is or how long it lasts.  I once dropped one after a year and broke it, but it seemed nowhere near quitting, so I can't vouch for how long it would work under normal, non-butterfingered conditions.  My assumption is that anything with such a high RPM rate isn't intended to be kept running for long periods of time-- creates too much heat and friction-- so if you plan to grind coffee night and day, it's probably best that you spend the money on a professional model intended for cafes. All in all, a fine piece of workmanship and definitely worth the extra few dollars over many of the other, cheaper, more poorly-designed grinders on the market today.\n"

aS'\nThis movie is great! It brings to mind elements of films like "Identity" and "And Then There Were None". Throw a group of profilers on an island, add a killer to take them out one by one, and you have a great thriller! I have to admit that I saw the previews and thought that maybe it was all a set up to test them, but after the first death, you know they aren\'t faking it! If you like last-minute plot twists, you\'ll love this movie. Fair warning that the deaths are incredibly graphic sometimes so no eating while watching. It was great to see Val Kilmer and Christian Slater back in action, even if they were in small parts (Kilmer has maybe 10 minutes of screen time).\n'

aS"\nI purchased these through the fullbar website a few weeks back.  One, to see if they worked, two if they tasted good and three if other's found them helpful as well.  What I found is for me they are tasty and filling.  I then gave a few of my overweight patients some to try.  They found them to be very helpful.  The very overweight patients lost on average 2lbs+/wk for the last 3 weeks.  Normal weighted people, like myself, haven't lost in pounds, but I feel firmer as do they.  I am a massage therapist, so I am pretty muscular, but I would like to stay healthy and maintain normal eating habits so this bar is great for me for just that reason, but it does seem to help with weight loss as well.  I have tried all the flavors of these bars and they are all pretty tasty...No,they aren't horrid or dry, but they aren't snickers bars either.  Just a fine, not overly done flavor that does fill you up prior to eating.  I ate before lunch and dinner.  Smoothie for breakfast.  \n \n Just in case you are wondering the average Nutrition Facts on all the bars are:\n Total Fat 3g--- Sat.

aS"\nThe Criterion Collection release of Armageddon is a treat.  It offers 2 commentary tracks, one featuring the director Michael Bay, actors Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck.  Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has comments on several interesting things.  Affleck's commentary is sometimes very funny.  The other commentary track features the Director of Photography and special effects people. The commentary includes interesting details, including background information on the characters and filming locations.  Note:  The commentary is raw and sometimes laced with profanity, although the movie itself is rated PG-13, for reasons explained in the commentary.   Although it's not much, this collection is also a Director's Cut and has a couple scenes added, notable of which is Harry Stamper's character visiting his father before launch.  Some other scenes are cut slightly differently, adding some depth to the story. The Gag reel on the second disk is extremely funny, raw, and not your typical &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; documentary. The second disk also features a tremendous amount of information on the special effects and includes many different trailers and promo material.  The Aerosmith song video is also included. While the story can be nit-picked, it's still very exciting and enjoyable.  Overall, if you liked the movie, the Criterion Collection release is the DVD to have.\n"

aS"\nI've been a long time AT&T costumer. I thought I could live without having an actual keyboard when it comes to texting, but after a week without my Sidekick Keyboard - I decided to ditch my Samsung Eternity for the Blackberry Bold 9700.\n\nI was hesitant about purchasing this smart phone because I was never a fan of Blackberry's (RIMM). I had a BB during their initial boom in the early part of the new millennium. However, the poor browser, poor cell phone network, lackluster screen color, non desirable keyboard, awful battery life, whack OS, & lack of T9 predictive text just couldn't win me over.\n\nAfter I realized that I couldn't text on a touch screen phone, unless it was the iPhone. I decided that I must have a cell phone device with an actual qwerty keyboard, if I expect to survive my text message & email addiction.\n\nI picked up the Blackberry 9700 with my corporate discount and walked away with a nice high end phone at a very reasonable price. I have to say that I really enjoy the web browser on the new BB. You can zoom in & out with ease. I thought no browser could compare to the iPod Safari besides the Android G1, but after getting this device - I can safely say that this browser is also one of the best. Its right behind the safari and G1. Prior models were confined to small screens, thirty-five dollar internet only data plans, and no ability to zoom in or out. You were subjected to a small screen and reading small text till your eyes was squinting like grandmas.\n\nPros:\n3G\nNew Optical Trackpad (Over the old Trackball)\nBig vibrant screen\nThreaded Text Messaging\n3.5 MM headjack\nNew OS (Runs a bit quicker without the lag time)\nDecent call quality\nExcellent new broswer\nMini SD up to 32GB\nUse your songs as ringers\nWi-Fi\nPersonal Email (Up to 10 accounts can be added)\nIM\nThemes\nApp Store\nMy Favs\nFull HTML Web Browser (Sometimes)\nExcellent Multimedia Player (Accepts every format possible)\nIncludes 2 chargers (Wall Charger & USB charger)\nIncludes ear phones and carry case\n\nCons:\nFor long time BB users, this device is really just a cosmetic upgrade with a new OS (Flashier Icons)\nMicro USB (No more Mini USB)\nVideo & Camera (3.2 Megapixel as oppose to 8.0)\nCheap plastic rubber casing\n\nNon RIMM Consumer Changes Mind!\n\nFor anyone who has wanted a BB but held off on getting one and want an entry level Blackberry at a decent price - this is the model to get. Everything about it is an upgrade. The device is basically the BB Bold with a different casing. The battery life could still use some more juice. With excessive email checking & non stop texting, the phone usually needs a charge after a day and a half of usage (Sometimes i can go a charge for 2 days before a charge so thats not bad). I did set the brightness of the phone to the lowest brightness available and it has lasted for a little over 2 days with no charge needed. Even on the lowest brightness, the screen is still very bright, sharp, & crisp. And i still do unlimited texting & web browsing. However, AT&T doesn't offer the best mobile minute plans on earth & their data plan is probably one of themost expensive around. They are fully aware that their signal is one of the best & in doing so, make up for it by charging their non-friendly services at non-friendly prices, which usually doesn't offers an abundant amount of minutes, unlimited data, internet, email, text etc will end up costing you a lot!\n\nI pay under seventy bucks a month for a decent amount of mins & unlimited everything else. My friend has a similar plan on Verizon, its not unlimited, and her bill is always over a hundred each month.\n"

aS"\nOne Tree Hill - The Complete Sixth Season is arguably the best season of this much-loved drama. Season 5 really caught my attention last year, I have to admit I never cared for this show when these characters were in high school, the storylines were over-the-top but now I enjoy the maturity. I have recently gone back and watched the previous seasons and I still don't care for all the hoopla - Season 6 is just brilliant so start here and work your way back. Sophia Bush's character Brooke Davis really got to shine this season, she took in Sam, a wise beyond her years teenage girl - fell in love with Peyton's ex Julian and made amends with her emotionally distant mother. The season finale seemed like a series finale but I heard the show will back next season. This prime time soap is a guilty pleasure and I am proud of it!\n"

aS"\nAnthropology of an American Girl is poignantly true to the time, the place and the culture of the East End of Long Island. This coming-of-age novel, refreshingly free of shame, blame and guilt, describes the indescribable world-rocking nuance of sexual thrall.  Readers cannot help but re-live their own urgent youth and will envy Eveline's power to consciously surrender herself to love.  The characters are drawn brilliantly, and we believe every word and deed in this remarkable book. Ms. Hamann is also objectively honest in her description of the darkest pockets of a young community, such as casual rape, incidental violence, and drugs.  In the end the reader is satisfied and believes in humanity.  This is a wonderful book.\n"

aS"\nThere are some things to consider before buying this particular card or any other 32gb SDHC card on the market:  \n \n 1. This is NOT an ideal card for a digital SLR like a D80, D90, Rebel XT, etc... That is because it is a class 4 device. The class of a SDHC cards has to do with how fast they read and write files, not how much storage they have. For a digital SLR, you should purchase a class 6 SDHC card most of the time. Class 6 cards will allow you to take 'bursts' of photos and not be limited by the card's capacity to write them. Also class 4 cards are slower reading data, meaning they will take longer to upload files to your computer. Upload speed is convenient, especially when loading large batches of files.  \n \n 2. This card has far more storage than most people will need for their digital camera. Unless you like to keep all your photos on a SDHC card and never move them to your computer, or are a high volume photographer, there is very little need for more than about 8gb of storage space for most caeras. The possible exception to this is if you have a professional SLR that shoots files in the 16-20mb range--but if you do, you'll likely want a class 6 card anyway. If all you intend to use this card for is a digital camera, save yourself a lot of money and buy a PNY 8GB SDHC Card . If you're worried about running out of space on a vacation, buy a few of them. Otherwise you run the risk of having 'all your eggs in one basket.' If one card fails, you lose all your pictures instead of only a portion of them. \n \n This card is fantastic for use in a video camcorder capable of writing to an SDHC card. (Check with the manual first to insure that a class 4 card will be fast enough first). It is also perfect as extra storage for an ultra portable computer or net book like the Asus EEE pc. Another great application would be as added storage to a personal media player or MP3 player equipped with a SDHC slot such as the Cowon D2 . \n \n There are other good 32gb SDHC cards on the market, some at cheaper price points than the Kingston card. IMHO, brand matters very little with something like a SDHC card, since they all are made pretty much the same way. None of the brands currently offering them (Transcend, PNY, Kingston) have high fail rates with their other products, so I believe they are all pretty similar. What you decide to buy will depend on whether you trust a particular brand, or who has the lowest price. All of them will work equally well.\n"

aS'\nI recieved this filter with my Keurig B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System  for Christmas this year, so I cannot review its durability.  I have some worries based on the previous reviews, but I\'ll hope for the best.  As far as the coffee this makes, it is great.  Of course, it greatly depends on the coffee you use.  The coffee I find myself using most in the filter is Peet\'s Major Dickason\'s Blend, but I\'ve tried many others and they are all superb.  It is hard to believe, but this produces a cup of coffee just as good as a K-Cup.  It is nice to be able to fill it to the very top to get a nice strong cup, as well as use coffees not available in K Cups.  It also saves a lot of money.  I try to use this more than K Cups and that will keep the expense of K Cups low enough for me.  Note: Many reviews specify a type of grind, but I find that a medium grind that you would find in a bag of pre-ground works great.  Also, filling it to the top leaving a little room works best for me.  If this lasts a reasonable amount of time, it is\n certainly worth the price to replace it.  UPDATE: I have already reviewed this product.  I got it this Christmas with a Keurig B40.  I got a "good" my k cup.  I was worried by the bad reviews about it breaking.  Clearly, some of these are made faulty.  I found this when i bought a second so I wouldn\'t have to wash the first over and over.  I got a "bad" one.  These filters are great, unless you get a bad one.  Before you use your new filter, make sure that the top EASILY tightens onto the filter.  If it does, you have a good one.  If it is difficult, return it go get another.  If your are buying in store, check first.  If you own a Keurig, you need one of these, but make sure you get the right one!  (UPDATE: 6 months later; the filter still works great, but I have found that only coarsely ground coffee will work without it getting clogged.  If you are using medium/fine ground coffee and it gets clogged, leaving you with little coffee, use coarsely ground.  It took me a while to figure this out.  Now it works every time.\n'

aS'\nMOMMY\'S LITTLE GIRL reads like a novel built on excellent organization & story development.  Unfortunately, it is not fiction.  The victim & protagonist, Caylee Anthony was a real child and Casey Anthony, the antagonist you love to hate was her mother.  Diane Fanning exhibited an uncanny ability to make the reader feel he/she experienced the unfolding of this story.  It\'s amazing how we can relate to these characters, good & bad.  Certainly it\'s not over yet but time and the courts will write the final chapter.\n \n The research and organization that went into MOMMY\'S LITTLE GIRL shows a mastery of the craft as does the ability to create a sense of the flow of this story that unfolded in starts, jerks, detours and stops.  It would have been easy to just lay out the facts & say, "Here it is!" but in fact, that is left for the reader. Even the well-written afterword leaves room for the reader to draw conclusions.  \n \n I strongly recommend this book for anyone trying to delve into the details of this or any true crime case.  It\'s definitely a step above.\n'

aS"\nI got my DSi when I traded in my DSlite.  So, considering that I paid well under $100, I am very happy with it.  I like the built in sound and photo manipulators.  The kids and I have had a blast with them.  The larger screen doesn't make a huge difference but it does look really nice.  I was really sold by the downloadable content, browser(though not used much), cameras and the sd slot.  Awesome features.  I also like the improved volume control as it was very hard to fine tune the volume on my DS lite. I think its a real shame that they didn't include a GBA slot on this one, though it clearly wasn't a deal breaker.  The only other negative is that I'm not crazy about the matte finish.  That's simply a matter of taste, however.  If they had left the GBA slot intact I would have given the DSi the fifth star.\n"

aS'\nI, too, did the research. I read the glowing reviews on this site and found other sources to be just as affectionate in their ratings. It\'s all based on personal experience, of course. Three days after I got this lemon, it died (as so did 165 of my songs). I called technical support and they said, "dude, you\'re screwed." Luckily, Amazon refunded the entire amount.\n \n I noticed, but not pay much attention to, the reviews on this site that gumbled that their Sansas died after a few days or months. So, take a close look at those reviews. I went ahead and bought an Ipod and...as of now it has worked like a charm.\n'

aS'\n(A tip to other reviewers: Don\'t rate an item if you don\'t own it. Some of these reviews are from people who haven\'t even seen this player!)\n \n This item arrived quickly, on a Saturday to our surprise, via Fedex. It\'s a gorgeous (if you like simple/shiny black) piece of AV equipment. At first, we were dismayed by what we thought were little scratches on the top - it was just a piece of protective plastic on it  that is removable; it does have a flawless finish.  \n \n I don\'t usually leave reviews even though I buy on Amazon frequently, and I feel a bit guilty giving this rave reviews as I work for a competitor, but they haven\'t come out with a similar product yet. We mostly wanted to upgrade the family room/media room for our teens to give them more reason to hang out home with their friends - I must say, that works. They can\'t wait to show off another blu-ray to friends (who are self-impressed audiophiles for the most part) who are very impressed. The only problem, is, we want to watch it as much as they do... we never used to watch TV this much. I know this sounds like an ad but really, it\'s that amazing.\n \n The tech stuff:\n The ease of setup, connection to the TV and the internet is simple and straightforward. One HDMI cable to TV (included w/TV), done. Plug in Ethernet if you don\'t want to use wireless. It\'s pure digital output - sound and video. It has a separate Digital audio out for those who were worried about the extra HDMI output. The sound is astonishing. Digital sound, can\'t beat it. (We\'re using it with a Philips Soundbar now, but the TV itself has great sound). If you don\'t have a hi-def TV it might not work as well, but then why buy it anyway? The instruction booklet is good clear English, not written by someone with English as a second-language. The only thing that looks daunting to me is the remote control, but the kids don\'t seem to have a problem with it.\n \n It performs beautifully in video and sound. It uses 1.4 cables (don\'t do what we did and buy 1.3 cables, besides the TV comes with cables). It runs on wifi to access the internet, and can download Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, etc., etc., content, and came with coupons for that. The kids like the internet part; we use it much less than they do.\n \n It works flawlessly with our TV. We own the Samsung UN46C7000 46-Inch 3D HDTV and love it; together it\'s a marriage made in Home Theater Heaven.  It\'s SUPER fast compared to other blu-Rays we have used. This is the first *3D* blu-ray we have used, and comparing it to regular 2-D blu-rays, it blows them all away. It up-converts beautifully and our 2-D blu-ray videos look like a dream on this.  \n \n We have only had it for days so we will write more when we have had more movies under our belts, but: older 3d movies look amazing, regular 2-D (most blu-rays are still) and downloads. All we can say so far is WOW. If you are interested in upgrading to a new 3D TV in the near future, this is a no-brainer to buy, \n \n Movies we suggest to knock your socks off: \n National Geographic 3D movies, Polar Express, Bugs!,the IMAX movies, and the new Micheal Jackson movie. Older teens liked the Bloody Valentine movie. The kids - even my son - reverted to movies like Snow White (the new blu-ray) to my surprise, just because it was so "flipping awesome" to watch on this player.\n \n WARNING: If you have a hard time pulling yourself away from the TV set (we never used to like we do now) - don\'t buy this. You won\'t want to leave the room.\n \n If you\'re looking for a top-notch, latest technology Blu-ray player with extras that\'s going to work quickly, this is a good buy. I\'ve blathered on enough; check it out.\n'

aS'\nFirst off, I researched for days before buying this Shark Mop.  Many of the reviews slammed it due to lack of pivoting head, small tank and flimsy handle.\n \n Well, the NEW model has NONE of these issues!  The head pivots, the water tank is much larger (I cleaned my medium sized kitchen and entryway floor and still have almost a full thing of water) and it feels pretty sturdy - not flimsy.  The handle is also adjustable in height to make it easier.\n \n Now to how it performed.  Let me start by saying house cleaning week saw me with 2 or more different mops!  I have laminated wood flooring, hardwood flooring and kitchen tile.  The Swiffer Wet Jet I bought left streaks on my laminate, was afraid to use it on the hardwood and since my kitchen tile is bumpy and uneven it left puddles and some areas would not even get touched by Wet Jet pad.  So, I would clean my laminate with windex on my knees, my hardwood with hardwood cleaner and mop and my kitchen with a rope mop w/ammonia and water (ONLY thing that would pick up the grime this horrible floor attracts).  Having been diagnosed with a spinal disease, I would be hurting and exhausted from the bending, lifting bucket of water and mopping action.  I finally got fed up and went to Bed, Bath and Beyond to try the Shark Mop - bad reviews and all.\n \n I have NEVER mopped so many floors so fast, had them ALL looking great AND not be hurting or exhausted.  I can actually say mopping if FUN with this!  Now remodeling the second bathroom, it will have a different type of laminate - i\'m so glad I will NOT have to have a 4th mop or system to clean it too.  The grime on the horrible, bumpy white tile in the kitchen?  It is so clean and streak free I\'m keep looking at it with the thought of "wow" going through my head.  It NEVER looked this good and ALWAYS had streaks unless I squirted some Jet Dry in the mop water.\n \n In addition, after cleaning the kitchen floor, while preparing dinner, I had dropped the spatula with butter and egg on the floor. Then the youngest child decided to walk through the garage with bare wet feet and then onto my clean white tile floor.  30 seconds of heat up and less than 60 seconds later, floor was clean again.  SO EASY.  I will NEVER go back to regular mopping ever again.  I can\'t wait to try it in the travel trailer (I do that linoleum on my hands and knees after trips).\n \n You won\'t be disappointed in the new one - spend the extra $$$ to get larger tank, pivoting head, extra mop head attachments and steam duster!\n'

aS"\nLittle Women was my favorite book as a child, and I still re-read it at least yearly as an adult for the comfort it gives me. I've probably read it 50 times over the last 30 years. I have also seen every filmed version of the book that I could, and was never completely satisfied.  I held my breath as this version of the story rolled onto the screen. I was enchanted. It was all there, from the scenery to the costumes to the characters.  Winona Ryder perfectly captured my fiery Jo, Kirsten Dunst the vanity of Amy, and Clair Danes the real depths of Beth, without any of them becoming a caricature. I loved the way Trini Alvarado, an actress new to me, potrayed the earnest, wistful, practical Meg. The passionate, fun-loving yet moody Laurie was perfectly found in Christian Bale, and the only difference between Gabriel Byrne and the professor I've always imagined is that Gabriel Byrne is more handsome. Aunt March had more dimensionality to her than in the book (and what a joy to see Mary Wickes in the role!). But the spirit that Louisa May Alcott gave to her book was caught ethereally in Marmee, as portrayed by Susan Sarandon.  She was the real foundation of the film, and expanding her character was the wisest decision Gilllian Armstrong made. Yes, some of the things in the film were not in the book, but they were so consistent with the story, so central to the March family philosophy, that perhaps they should have been!  I never thought that my beloved book could be improved upon, but it has been in this film. I also wish to mention the sets, the cinematography and the music, all which added so much to make my imagined world of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy become real.  Thank you to everyone who worked on this precious film.\n"

aS'\nI am SO happy to finally have a bathroom scale that WORKS!  My old Taylor scale was just crap.  Seriously.  I lost so much motivation because of that thing, it would give me different weights anywhere within a 5-pound "range" every time I stepped on it, so I never had any idea what I actually weighed, or whether or not my hard work was paying off.  Drove me nuts!  \n \n Because of that, I put my new EatSmart scale through a lot of "tests" when I got it today.  I stepped on it 5 times in a row, alternating between it and the old Taylor scale each time.  The old scale gave me 5 completely different numbers, as usual, but the EatSmart stayed the same each time!  I even tried putting the laundry basket on it in between weighs, to make sure it wasn\'t just "remembering" the last number.  Nope!  So then I tried drinking a big glass of water, and sure enough, the EatSmart registered a .6 pound increase.  Fantastic!  I\'m so pleased with the consistency and accuracy of this scale.  I\'m feeling 100x more energized and motivated than I was yesterday, because I know now I\'ll be able to see the REAL results of my actions, good or otherwise.  :)\n'

aS'\nFable II, the aptly-named sequel to Fable, hit the markets a while back. I didn\'t have a way to play it then, but I do now, so even if this review isn\'t terribly timely, I hope you\'ll find it helpful.\n \n The game takes place in the world of Albion, a beautiful, lovely world somewhere between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. In that it quickly differentiates itself from most fantasy worlds.\n \n You play the Hero. You don\'t get a name, but you can get titles (like Lionheart, Executioner or the NAMBLA-friendly, Chicken Chaser). You can be male or female, good or evil. You can marry the opposite sex or the same sex. You can customize your looks with new hair styles, tattoos, facial hair and hair dye. You get all sorts of different clothes to pick from, and get scars when you die. You also age.\n \n In addition, you get a whole slew of skills. You can learn how to chop wood, for example. If that\'s not exciting enough, you can also tend bar! Blacksmithing, bounty hunting and a couple other jobs round things out.\n \n If jobs aren\'t your thing, you can go on a whole series of quests, though not very many. During these quests, you can earn gold which you can use to buy all the usual stuff, plus real estate. Yes, if you want you can become the next Donald Trump! One of my friends has done this and basically owns every bit of property that can be owned.\n \n This is an action RPG, which is different from regular RPGs in that you don\'t select options from a menu screen. No, instead you bash, smash and crush your enemies by repeated button-mashing. Think of the Zelda games. You have both melee weapons and ranged weapons as well as a series of spells, some of which can be lots of fun!\n \n Along the way, you have a dog acting as your faithful companion. Allegedly he helps in fights, but not so you\'d notice. What he mostly does is sniff out treasure, and that\'s a damn nice thing, given how well-hidden some of the treasure chests are.\n \n Graphics wise, this is one of the most beautiful games on any system. Everything looks gorgeous, even the darker and more unpleasant spots.\n \n If it seems like I\'m focusing overly much on the non-story aspects of the game, it\'s cause the story, well, kind of falls short. It\'s the usual "fight against someone who killed your sister" kind of plot. Nothing memorable. It\'s also rather brief. There\'s nothing wrong with it, per se, but it\'s not very original.\n \n Still, the joy is in the journey, and this is one of the best games of its kind out there. Highly recommended!\n'

aS"\nAside from the ingenious design of the track pad that allows the users to have more freedom and flexibility to navigate, macbook pro13 is extremely portable and reliable. I have been an avid PC user. I own 4 laptops and 2 of them are still PC. However, I am glad that I have bought a mac. The apps such as FInal Cut, iLife, and iWork seem to run very smoothly on this macbook. The LED screen is fantastic.

With all the upgrades that Apple has done with their macbooks, I think I finally feel that it's worth the spending to buy my first mac.\n \n My only complain is that it's still a lot more expensive than PC laptops with similar specs.

The author hits the reader early on with:\n \n -\tRove, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice were "enablers" for George Juniors\' idiocy (Powell in my view confused loyalty with integrity)\n -\tThe second term flame-out was avoidable--Bush had good intentions but Rove held sway \n \n + The author addresses Bush\'s faith as false, non-theological, more like "self-help Methodism," using Alcoholics Anonymous meetings instead of church as a group activity.\n \n + There is a superb discussion of the juxtaposition of Bush\'s linguistic blunders combined with the manner in which he was gifted at using evangelical and conservative code words.\n \n + There is fine coverage of George Juniors meanness and overbearing humiliating toward all, Rove in particular, who accepted every humiliation, including the nickname "Turd Blossom." \n \n + The author summarizes the scandals on Rove\'s watch: Plume, Katrina, Iraq, firing of prosecutors (I would also add, subversion of Congress in violation of Article one, see Breach of Trust and also Broken Branch).\n \n + We learn in passing that Rove was abandoned three times:\n \n -\tBy his father who ran away\n -\tBy his stepfather who ran away (one of the two was homosexual, I forget which)\n -\tBy his mother who committed suicide\n \n + It  was Rove, the author tells us, who pushed privatization of social security.  As I review this book there are ads on the radio that seek to communicate that 40% of America\'s shares are owned by normal people.  What they do not tell you, which you can lean in John Bogle\'s book,  The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism , is that we are no longer an ownership society, we have abdicated to financial management intermediaries, and they have skimmed one fifth of the value off for themselves, a select few.\n \n + According to the author it was Rove and not George Junior that pressed for a strategy of demonizing terrorism.  The author says Rove destroyed the Bush II presidency with the "catastrophic blunder of politicizing the War on Terror."\n \n + When the author finally gets around to covering Dick Cheney he casts him perfectly as "Lord Chief Justice" from Henry V, the sycophant who revels in pulling the strings behind the scenes.  I have the line, my own interpretation of the author\'s words, "played Bush like a fiddle."\n \n + The author asserts that Cheney was not transformed, as Brent Scowcroft believes, but rather finally found an opportunity to exercise his own judgment about the irrelevance of Congress and the need for a unilateral Presidency autonomous from oversight and able to take bold initiatives without consultation.  [See One Percent Doctrine for a review of Cheney\'s mal;feasance going back to the Ford Presidency, in ursurping Presidential power].\n \n + The author, editor in chief of Slate, observes that the press really missed this about Cheney, his intent focus on expanding Presidential power and dismissing Article 1 of the Constitution.\n \n + The author reminds us that Cheney went from intern to Chief of Staff of the White House in 6 years, and I cannot help wondering what pathologies came from too much power too soon (see The Pathology of Power - A Challenge to Human Freedom and Safety )\n \n + Addington receives concise but chilling coverage.\n \n + Pages 170-171 are a priceless summary of how Cheney\n \n -\tManaged Bush\'s mind\n -\tFramed choices\n -\tAccelerated Bush\'s neurotic shoot from the hip uninformed decision making (while ensuring behind that Cheney\'s decision was preset or, if necessary, counter-manding the President behind his back after the fact, alleging to others not in a position to question, that President had changed his mind).\n \n + The author discovered in Lynn Cheney\'s "Executive Privilege" (evidently no longer carried by Amazon) a telling fictional tale all too real.\n \n + The section I found most interesting outlined the six phases of Bush Doctrine:\n \n -\t1.0  Unipolar Realism (we make reality in our own image)\n -\t2.0 With us or Against Us\n -\t3.0 Preemptive attack\n -\t4.0 Democracy in the Middle East\n -\t5.0 Freedom Everywhere\n -\t6.0 No doctrine at all\n \n + The author surprises me with one defense of Cheney that I consider credible: Cheney truly wanted to vaccinate the entire nation against smallpox because he truly believed the threat existed.  I am reminded of Daniel Elsberg who in Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers  recounts how he warned Henry Kissinger that reliance on Top Secret Codeword information would "make him like a moron, unable to listen to those who actually know."\n \n + The author tells us that Bush II reads books many of them "but does not know how to think historically."  I am reminded of my youngest son, 12 years old, a brilliant wide receiver and first baseman, who at this point can read a book and not remember a thing from the plot.\n \n + The author ends with a devastating comparison of Winston Churchill, who did outgrow Lord Randolph and make his mark, and George Junior who "in the end, ... failed to be his own man or displace his father."  Naturally there is the humiliating irony of proving that his father was right not to have gone on to Baghdad.\n \n I just shake my head wondering how the American people have been so silent.  Here are a few other books that round out the catastrophic decrepitude of the Bush-Cheney regime:\n \n Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency \n Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush\'s War on Iraq \n Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders \n Running On Empty: How The Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It \n A Pretext for War : 9/11, Iraq, and the Abuse of America\'s Intelligence Agencies \n Losing America: Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency \n \n Some time a go I wrote a piece on 9/11, "who\'s to blame," and it boiled down to this: We the People are to blame, for having dropped out of the democracy and abdicated our civic responsibilities.  Cheney\'s high crimes and misdemeanors, not least of which was letting 9/11 happen as FDR let Pearl Harbor happen, Congress abdicating its Article 1 responsibilities, the mainstream media refusing $100,000 fully paid ads against the war; a piss-ant like Wolfowitz being able to get away with questioning Shinseki\'s experience, insight, and honor--all of these are secondary causes and I would hasten to include the "failure of generalship," flag officer who, like Colin Powell, forgot their Oath of Office and confused loyalty with integrity.  The prime cause is that we gave our government over to what I now consider to be four organized crime families: the Clintons, the Bushes, the Democratic Party, and the Republican Party.  \n \n As McCaffrey said on CNN last night (13 Feb 08), "anyone who votes for an incumbent in 2008 should lose their American citizenship."  Tongue in cheek?  Perhaps.  Relevant and actionable?  Absolutely.  It\'s time to abolish this government and start over.\n'

aS'\nThe Ninja Master Prep is by far the best blender in the market.  Great technology, great design with the motor on the top so you can easily transfer from one task to the next.  I love it!! I had purchased the Vita Mix back in July 2009, I used it about six times and the motor burnt out!  I was able to return it without a problem but I really was looking for a machine like the Ninja.  I can make smoothies, and silky sorbets using frozen fruit.  I love it so much I bought two(2) of them! I purchased mine at Target for $49.99.  I think that was a great price after having spent $400.00 on the Vita Mix which in my opinion is old technology compared to the Ninja.   The Ninja really does perform great!! I would recommend this product to anyone who uses it for mixed drinks, sorbets and smoothies.  The double blade technology is a great inventions!! I was shocked at the price for this type of technology!!\n \n \n'

aS'\nI ordered this little beauty after killing my classic Doc Johnson...hehe.  This one is definitely better than any other battery-operated vibrator I have owned.  The unique shape makes getting those harder to reach "areas" much easier than using a traditional straight vibrator.  The vibrator is soft and flexible and the motor is located at the uniquely-shaped head.  One caveat: be sure to have plenty of AA batteries on hand because it does tend to drain them quickly!  Overall, a great vibrator to have in your arsenal!\n'

aS'\nFor 40 years I have had periodontal problems (gums receding). Recently I had to have surgery for the problem. At the same time both my dentist and periodontist suggested that I use the Sonicare tooth brush. I did and that has made all the difference in the world. In my last two visits to the periodontist, both complimented how much improvement I had made with my gums. Both encouraged me to do whatever I have been doing-which was brush with the Sonicare brushes. I find for myself that the compact brush head allows me to better reach all parts of my mouth.\n'

aS"\nA fairly good book, but based too completely on the movie, not all that much variation. There were a few differences here and there, the fight between Sub-Zero and that guard guy, a few of Sonya's fights, and a few of the things in Johnny's Battle with Scorpion, but not much else. Being a die-hard fan of the series myself, I really enjoyed it, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who isn't\n"

aS'\nFor months I made \'do\' with my $40 straightener trying to convince myself that it would be enough. I would see other women with perfect hair to find out they used a CHI. Everyone would say "A C-H-I...! ooohhhh Like it was something to worship. Well gals...It is the Mercedes Benz of hair straighteners. I am chanting CHI! CHI! CHI! everywhere I go.\n I have thick, wavy hair and it only took about 10 mins to iron it flat. It feels silky smooth too! and is so shiny! My $40 cheapie made it feel like straw.\n I know the high price may stop many women from buying it.\n But I swear, you HAVE to buy a CHI, if you are as fussy about your hair as I am, its a dream come true.\n Finally; we puffy, thick and wavy haired gals can have it all. \n It heats up fast and does not burn or singe the hair at all..but rather glides through my hair. I didn\'t experiencing it being overly hot either. Just perfect in every way.\n \n \n'

aS"\nLet me say, I've owned several Sony digital cameras over the years. First a DSC-P50 circa 2001, then a couple of random ones I purchased new and wound up selling because they had poor picture quality. Then in 2005 I purchased a Sony DSC-W7 (7.2 mp) point-and-shoot. This is a good little camera but the PQ has always been a little hit and miss. I would say I got one or two good shots out of every 100.\n \n Some problems with the W7 were autofocus that didn't focus properly (especially in indoor, low-light conditions), redeye was pervasive (even with the redeye reduction feature turned on), and shutter lag time. (One feature I liked about the W7 was the inclusion of an optical viewfinder, which it seems most of the manufacturers have now abandoned on these small digital cameras.)\n \n Most of these problems seem to be addressed with the newest (2010) generation of Sony DSC point-and-shoots. I decided this was the time to replace the W7, and it came down to a choice between a DSC-W330 and DSC-W370. After taking some test photos in the store, and sending those photos to my personal computer at home for analysis, I decided to purchase the W370.\n \n The W370 does not have an optical viewfinder, but it has everything else, and does everything right. The low-light, indoor shooting that the W7 could not handle is not an issue at all for the W370. Each indoor shot has been clear and well-focused, with exquisite background detail in shot after shot. In 10 test shots, only 1 came out bad, whereas with previous Sonys there might be 4 good shots and 6 bad.\n \n The quality is light years ahead of the W330. I was attracted initially to the W330 because of its sleek look and small form factor (the W370 does not have this sex appeal), but the W370 blew the 330 out of the water in terms of photo quality, especially autofocus (always sharp) and redeye reduction (no redeye or hint of redeye at all in shot after shot).\n \n In sum, I purchased the W370 and haven't looked back. This is an excellent little camera and everything a digital camera should be. Takes excellent photos whether indoors or out, natural light or artificial, bright conditions or low, etc. I highly recommend this product.\n"

It also looks great above water! I use it at my son's baseball games and I have been amazed at the quality. Hands down the best thing about this camera is the size. It's so easy to slip in a pocket and just carry around. Great little vacation camera. My only complaint is that the control wheel is a little small. I would often accidentally stop recording while trying to zoom in or out. You get used to it though and it is a minor annoyance. I highly recommend this camera.\n"

aS'\nI have used every Microsoft OS since DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1. Until now my favorite was Windows 2000. XP was pretty solid (after service pack 2) except for all of the security holes. Every time I would need to fix an XP machine it wasn\'t because of something wrong with the OS itself, but because the machine had virus/spyware/trojans etc. Enter Vista. MS fixed most of the security problems but did so at the expense of performance and stability. Now with Windows 7 you get the best of both worlds. XP was released in 2001 and hardware has come a long way since then, but the OS itself remained relatively static and could only take advantage of newer hardware at a basic level. Vista was an improvement and Windows 7 handles it better still. \n \n I think Vista, although I had few problems with it, will go down as ME 2.0. At the same time Windows 7 will be XP 2.0. People will cling to it and MS will have to kill it off before people will move on to it\'s next offering, whatever that may be. \n \n With that said I would highly recommend that both XP and Vista users upgrade. Unlike previous upgrades you will actually get better performance and use less resources post-upgrade. A first for MS. Security is rock solid. If XP is swiss cheese, then Win 7 is the wall of China. You no longer have to download the "patch of the day" from Windows Update. I haven\'t played around with Media Player, but Media Center is great for watching DVDs and remains pretty much unchanged from Vista. My favorite features are Jump Lists, AERO Snap (for working in two windows side by side). Networking is a bit easier (especially compared to XP). Performance is much improved from Vista and is comparable to or even faster than XP. Calculator, Paint, and Wordpad have been updated. If you are upgrading from Vista you do lose a couple of progams, namely Windows Mail and Photo Gallery. Updated versions can be downloaded from Windows Update for free. The only downside is that upgrading from XP requires a clean install. \n \n As far as the upgrade process itself goes, it\'s painless. Just be sure to run the upgrade advisor before you do. All that\'s required of you is a product key (at the end of the installation) and activation. So all you have to do is pop the disc in, grab a good book, and before you know it you\'re in computing heaven. \n \n \n'

aS"\nI have had this compressor for a couple of weeks now and really like it.  It is a high quality unit clearly built to last.  I chose this model over the very popular oil-free pancake compressors mainly for it's compact size and low noise level....and it did not dissappoint me.  I would say this unit is half as loud as those typical oil-fee models by P*rter C*ble.  I can easly run it indoors while remodeling a bedroom, and hardly hear in the room next door. The unit is compact, but much heavier duty than similar Cr*ftman compressors I saw at Sears.  It recycles quickly and fills the tank in less than 20 seconds.  It came with a good owner's manual and a bottle of oil.  I did have a problem where the plastic oil filler cap was cracked, but Makita quickly sent me a replacement part under warantee.  I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for an occasional use compressor and does not want something large or loud.\n"

aS'\nTo tell the truth, I wasn\'t looking forward to this film at all. I\'m a pretty big fan of most of Kevin Smith\'s work, but he didn\'t write the film. It could be argued that he did write Jersey Girl and that could be considered a bomb, but his films usually average about $25-$30 million anyway. A Kevin Smith film isn\'t really about bringing in a large amount of money at the box office. His charm is in his writing, especially the dialogue and interaction between characters. There\'s a very specific audience his films will appeal to and none of them have really branched away from that. But him not writing this one made me think, "Eh. Not sure what that\'ll be like since he didn\'t write it." When it comes to Bruce Willis, I\'ve never talked to anyone who dislikes him entirely. There always seems to be at least one of his films everybody enjoys. Die Hard, The Fifth Element, and Sin City are just a few off the top of my head. The real buzzkiller for me though was Tracy Morgan. He\'s just never been funny to me. He was beyond lame on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock has never been able to hold my attention for very long. Not to mention all the trailers for Cop Out didn\'t make me laugh. Thankfully though, first impressions can be so very wrong. \n \n One of Cop Out\'s biggest charms is that it feels like a buddy cop comedy you\'ve seen before, but have forgotten how much you enjoy it. The film feels similar to a 48 Hrs or Beverly Hills Cop film. Bulletproof is also a good example. Cop Out is pretty much what you expect when it comes to roles Bruce Willis chooses as it\'s pretty much no different than his role as John McClane on the surface, but he\'s a lot funnier this time around. As far as Tracy Morgan goes, the funniest thing I could remember him saying was his one line in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back ("Man... I don\'t know what the f--- you just said, Little Kid, but you\'re special man, you reached out, and you touched a brother\'s heart.") until this film. He was downright hilarious at times. The only person who was funnier than Morgan was Seann William Scott who stole every scene he was in. Even though Kevin Smith didn\'t pen the script this time around, it still feels like a Kevin Smith film. It could be due to the fact that Jason Lee has a small role in the film, but I like to think it\'s because Cop Out offers the same kind of comedy you\'d find in a Kevin Smith film with a bit more action. It also took me forever to place Scarface from Half Baked as Poh Boy. \n \n Cop Out is surprisingly funny and incredibly entertaining. Give this film a chance even if the trailers may not be doing anything for you. I felt the same way and wound up thoroughly enjoying the film. After a long, stressful day at work, an R-rated comedy with a lot of laughs is one of the best ways to relax and this film offers just that. It\'s a great film to go into with no expectations other than to just have a good time. As long as you don\'t run out of the theater, you should catch the part in the credits. This might just be the funniest film released in 2010 thus far. Be sure to check it out. Highly recommended.\n'

aS'\nAfter much research, I purchased two PS3 Slim\'s for my HDTV\'s because they come with built-in Wi-Fi and a great Blu-Ray player, in addition to being an awesome gaming system.  Plus, the HDMI connections are easy and excellent quality.  I\'m 62, and was looking for a box that would let me use the wide selection of Netflix instant download movies and programs.  I\'m happy to report that the picture and sound quality of Netflix downloads is very good on the PS3.  Much faster and better than I expected.  Not hi-def, but better than regular TV.  And I have the Blu-Ray to watch movies by mail from Netflix at the highest quality.  Blu-Ray really is an awesome experience if you have a big HDTV and a surround sound system.  I use the Sony CT-500 sound bar and subwoofer that has amazing sound quality and separation.\n \n Sony markets the PS3 as an "entertainment system" and I agree that it serves this function very well for me.  I returned my hi-def cable boxes to Cox and am now saving $65 per month that was being wasted on crummy channels with endless commercials that I never watched.  Now I can get quality programming that I choose myself instantly on demand from Netflix without any commercials.  I can play, pause, and re-play a program as much as I like, just like playing a DVD.  Sony PS3 plus Netflix really is wonderful and cost-effective solution for users like me...\n \n Highly recommended!\n \n \n'

aS'\nIt\'s without question. This is something all Evanescence fans need in their collection! I notice this to be something a lot of artists are doing these days, and it probably is just a ploy to cash in, but I personally enjoy live CDs, and especially DVDs, so you can relive the experience or merely feed your curiosity if you missed one of your favorite groups in concert. I haven\'t seen Evanescence in person yet but after watching the DVD portion of \'Anywhere But Home\', which was taped at a sold-out venue in Paris, I definitely think it would be worth it to try sometime. Amy Lee looks innocent yet deadly, her haunting vocals are in healthy form and the band sounds better than ever whilst they perform their greatest hits...which is basically everything since their melodies are all so unforgettable.... \n \n Many people claim Amy doesn\'t sing as well in concert as she does on her studio recordings and though they may be right, take into consideration the fact that she obviously gets really into the songs and because she jumps around so much, which equals exhaustion and breathlessness, I felt she did a pretty damn good job at controlling the words and pacing. You\'ll notice during the songs she sings while sitting at the piano, like on the wonderful Korn cover of "Thoughtless", the stunningly emotional "Breathe No More", and of course the infamous "My Immortal" she sounds quite better. Also, during a live event if you mess up there\'s no turning back so be grateful she doesn\'t lip synch like countless other acts around. And I\'m so sick of people dissing this group simply because they had a lucky break and hit it big thanks to the \'Daredevil\' soundtrack. I\'m not saying Evanescence is better than similar groups who get far less recognition (or at least in the states) like Lacuna Coil, \'cause they\'re not, but they\'ve also been around a while now so their fame didn\'t exactly happen over night.\n \n Bottom line is they\'ve got undeniable talent and they are, in my opinion, a blessing to mainstream music which is mostly full of crap. But back to the CD/DVD combo... \n \n Closing the set is the new, or rather recycled track "Missing" (originally found on their hard-to-find \'Origins\' CD) and it\'s a beautiful orchestral ballad, however it\'s the DVD that\'s truly spectacular! Aside from the concert it also features a lot of bonus material, and it isn\'t just filler either. The behind the scenes is great because you get to see a little of how they are in real life and it\'s not at all boring. It also includes all their videos to date, which are some of the most inventive I\'ve seen in a long time ("Everybody\'s Fool" is without a doubt my favorite). And for the most part the concepts actually relate to the lyrics.\n \n I predict Evanescence will be around for many years to come and I can\'t wait to hear their new album set for release sometime next year.\n'

aS'\nDespite heartrending descriptions of sexual abuse, racism, poverty, homeless and much, much, more in modern India, this is an utterly enjoyable picaresque adventure that is one of the best reads of the year. In the hands of another author, the brief life story Ram Mohammad Thomas would probably be told as a simple tearjerker tragedy and the reader would be left to shake their head sorrowfully at the plight of another poor third-world soul. However, Swarup has a gimmick framework up his sleeve, and it works like a charm. Granted, one has to be willing to go along with the premise that this entire structure is based on coincidence of colossal proportions -- readers who aren\'t willing to suspend disbelief will probably not last more than a few chapters. \n \n We first meet the 18-year-old protagonist in jail, where he sits accused of defrauding the popular TV game show "Who Wants to Be A Billionaire?" (in rupees). Despite being abandoned at birth, uneducated, and left to fend for himself for most of his life, it seems Ram somehow managed to answer the show\'s twelve questions correctly. To all outside observers, his social standing and lack of education appear to preclude this happening legitimately. However, just as the police are about to unleash some heavy manners on him, a mysterious lawyer intervenes and takes him away. The story then unfolds question by question, as Ram tells her via flashbacks to his life just how he managed to know each answer.\n \n Ram\'s life story unfolds as a series of episodes ranging from the horrific to the merely tragicomic, and in a sense, one can view him as emblematic of India\'s lost children, and the book as caustic social commentary on contemporary India. Aside from being abandoned at birth, he must contend with a pedophile priest, a closeted homosexual movie star, a violent, drunken neighbor bent on incest, international espionage, child slavery, numerous thieves, a suicidal employer, and the deaths of several close friends. And yet, despite this bleak subject matter, the intrepid Ram keeps doggedly moving forward and surviving. This isn\'t done in a sentimental, "triumph of the human sprit", after-school special way, but in a straightforward manner that shows a confused young boy doing whatever it takes to live. And of course, the ultimate moral of the story is that those who keep their eyes and ears open in life can learn a lot about it without any books. An excellent story, well-told, and doubtless to be made into a film.\n'

aS"\nI cannot really understand why one of the previous reviewers had those problems. With the Gamepad comes an installation program (Version 4.3a) and after installing you have a whole bunch of options to choose from to setup your controller. Once you figured out how to set it up right (very good manual), the controller works flawlessly in all my games without any problems. Both analog and digital controls are usable. The buttons are good to reach and the handling is better than every other controller i had before. I changed from a MS Sidewinder Pro Gamepad to this one because my thumbs hurt after only a couple of minutes playing with the MS Product. This is much better. Very ergonomic! I cannot give 5 stars though, because the &quot;Aftershock&quot; feature is not impressive, but i really couldn't care less about this.\n"

But if you already have the 2nd gen. ipod touch you should save yourself the money and wait for the 4th. when hopefully a camera and a built-in mic would be standard features because this is not such a major update besides a faster processor, new stock headphones, and lower prices.\n \n However, this ONLY applies to the 32GB and 64GB versions as others have noted. The 3rd gen. 8GB version is exactly the same as the 2nd gen. except it is repackaged so even with the reduced price, the 8GB is an inferior deal.\n \n The first thing I noticed was how much the price of the ipod touch has dropped since its debut. The 16GB was $399 when it first came out and now this 32GB is only $299 ($279 on amazon). This does makes sense because that is how the market works but this is a very good deal.\n \n Obviously $300 is not money to be thrown around, but the ipod touch is well-rounded and offers many features other than just being a decent music player. I personally could not tell any difference in sound quality from my 1st gen. and my 3rd gen. touch, which is a major disappointment because the basic function of an ipod is a music player and improvements are always welcome if not necessary. \n \n The 3rd gen. offers really shoddy and quiet internal speakers, which is better than nothing on the 1st gen. and the stock Apple headphones are just terrible.  Note that the 32GB and 64GB versions come with headphones that have a built-in mic and music player controls, but they are basically the same. So you should factor in the cost of buying new headphones. \n \n Some respectable brands for headphones or earbuds are Klipsch, Shure and Bose. I personally use Bose overear headphones because the noise that they block off really makes a difference on the crowded subway. While looking for headphones keep in mind that like all things out there, price and quality (and warrenties) have a direct correlation. But really, the ipod touch sound quality is not bad at all as much as I bash it.\n \n What makes me give 5 stars to this 3rd gen. ipod touch is the fact that its overall package is unmatched in the market today, even with the new Zune HD (the Zune has a much inferior internet browser and limited apps). I am not going to make a comparison between them because both music players attract different audiences, where ipod touch users prefer the apps and the interface while zune users find the Zune Marketplace to be much better than itunes (Marketplace prices for music are cheaper and are a better value especially for heavy downloaders). But for the casual music listener, both are the very similar in form, function, and price.\n \n The 3rd gen. ipod touch has a terrific internet browser that is superior to the Blackberry, but its limitations are that it requires a wifi connection and it does not support adobe flash. I use it to jot down notes quickly, to view my documents on my subway to study, check my mail, look up something quickly on the internet, and obviously to listen to music. There is a plethora of apps that can be downloaded and many are free and quite useful like AIM and SportsTap, and Remote. Apple advertises the ipod touch for the games that it can play and you will not be disappointed if you want to play something on the go.\n \n Th 3.5 inch screen is crisp and watching videos is a pleasure. And the ipod touch does look great with clean lines but if you don't want to get the backplate scratched, you must by a case. The screen itself on the other hand is very scratch-resistant. \n \n I highly recommend the new 3rd generation ipod touch for those who are looking for something in this price range and want a balanced music player that can also play vidoes, surf the web, and play quick  games. In a way, people are also paying for the Apple brand, which is not a bad thing considering you can bring your ipod to the apple store to get it fixed, you can purchase many different accessories, and you can have special compatibility features with other apple products such as with macbooks if you already own one or your school/business uses them.\n"

aS'\nFirst, I\'m not sure what the abundance of U-238 is in this sample. In any case, if you want this for "experimenting," note that this is NOT the U-235 that you probably should be looking for. If this sample is pure, even though it\'s just U-238, it deserves 4 stars. But only 3 for now, since no information is provided here.\n'

aS"\nWe got this as a gift a few years ago and have not used it to often and usually for about four waffles each time we used it. So I think that is why it worked for as long as it did. We had the fuse burn out on us this weekend. I looked at other reviews and took the maker apart to maybe fix it on my own. Once I looked inside and found the fuse I didn't feel comfortable that my fix would be protected from the heat so I decided to trash it.  We are going to look for one that takes up less space and will last 10 or so years, which I think these should. Frustrating though, I think it would be an easy design update to make the fuse a pop in and out type. That would be easy to change out and make this last the time it should.\n"

aS'\nWhen we last saw Kelly, Ozone, and Turbo, they were starring in a Broadway show called "Street Jazz."\n \n Fast forward an amount of time (we are never told how much time has passed) and we find that our trio has parted ways. Kelly is now an in-demand Broadway star and Ozone and Turbo are back home volunteering at their community recreation center. Once again, Kelly tires of her life and heads back to the street to see Ozone and Turbo. Eventually, the three of them put together a dance show they hope will save the community center from being demolished to make room for a new shopping center.\n \n "Breakin\' 2: Electric Boogaloo" was released just 7 months after the first movie. Unfortunately, that short time span shows in this sequel.\n \n Like the original "Breakin\'" movie, "Electric Boogaloo" is full of 80s style dancing, mainly break dancing as well as poppin\' and lockin\'. And also like the original, this movie shines brightest when the focus is on the dancing.\n \n Unfortunately for the movie, and for us, the plot line was expanded this time around. The writing has an awkward feel to it. Every time the dancing pulls you into the movie, the lines that are uttered pull you right back out. In addition, the increased plot highlights the acting inexperience of the stars.\n \n If I was to base the rating for Breakin\' 2 only on the plot, writing, and acting, it would only receive one-star. However, once again the dancing is the main star of the show. And if I was to base the rating only on the dancing, it would receive five-stars (it\'s really that good). So a good compromise is in order here, hence the three-star rating.\n \n'

aS"\nI have used Olympus cameras in the past without any complaints.  This camera holds up to our expectations.  The picture quality is amazing.  The scene modes perform well, but we don't use them that often, we prefer to point and shoot with the auto-mode.  This camera is replacing a 3MP nikon coolpix, that finally wore out.  Just remember when you buy this camera, it is a pocket sized digital camera for around $100.  Don't expect to be taking photos for National Geographic!!  It is a great little camera  :)\n"

aS'\nAt a certain point, a marvelous band will get a reputation so overwhelming, it\'s simply not possible for them to keep topping themselves.\n \n And from the sound of "In Rainbows," Radiohead has decided not to let their reputation loom over them -- and I\'m not just talking about the online digital release. In their latest album, they reinvent their bittersweet pop sound -- they lose some of the trappings of their past work, in favour of warmer, more intimate melodies and traditional instrumentation.\n \n It opens on an angular note with "15 Steps," which is built around a jagged riff.The first couple minutes are full of fuzzy synth stabs and sharp drums, sounding like a jazz number that\'s being eaten by a computer. "How come I end up where I started?/How come I end up where I went wrong?" Thom Yorke sings mournfully. "You reel me out then you cut the string..."\n \n But then the guitars slide in and twine through the song, softening it into something very different. The scratchy synth beats and subtle guitar start building to a slow crescendo, staying energetic and almost reggae-esque right to the end.\n \n See it as kind of a transition song for Radiohead; they\'re easing listeners into their new acoustic sound, rather than just dropping us in. But after that, they pretty much leave the "Kid A" territory behind them -- "Bodysnatchers" is an intense rocker brimming with chunky riffs and softly ringing guitars. It\'s a gorgeous piece. \n \n After that, the songs gently slip down into more introspective territory -- smooth, dark pop songs wrapped in a heavy blanket of fluid strings and subtle slide guitar. Some of these are dressed up in thick guitars and clattery drums. "Jigsaw Falling Into Place drops the strings for a vibrant guitar-rocker edged with synth, and it all finished up with the quivering, melodic finale "Videotape."\n \n You know, I didn\'t think that Radiohead could surprise me. So many bands get mired in their best-known sound, and they keep turning out the same ol\' because that is what the fans expect. But Radiohead has not only made an exquisitely bittersweet pop album, but they\'ve also injected vitality back into their sound. They sound brand new.\n \n Particularly, they\'ve almost abandoned the cool, alien synth of their last few albums. It\'s still there in patches, but it\'s quietly overwhelmed by the layers of slide guitar, streams of piano, and smooth sweeps of elegant strings. These are seamlessly woven with  clattering drums and cymbals, thick crunchy riffs. And yes, occasionally a little speck of synth.\n \n But their songwriting is much the same -- simple, yet oblique ("I am a moth who just wants to share your light... I only stick with you because there are no others/You are all I need"). While Yorke\'s trademark wail is still in place, he sounds more melancholy and contemplative than outright woe-is-me angsty. He even sounds a bit cheerful in "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi."\n \n Most long-standing bands can\'t summon up a new sound, and new freshness, this far into their careers. But Radiohead have created a quiet little masterpiece in "In Rainbows" -- beautiful, quiet, and melancholy.\n'

aS"\nThis is my favorite movie of all time. Period. You can sit inon the most interesting conversation ever and I've done it many times,every time finding myself thinking of different things, contemplating my own life and wondering about how crazy Andre actually is and how seriously to take his ideas about how human life came to an end a few decades ago, leaving us all robots in search of some twinge of real feeling. But the dvd is so bad I suspected it was a bootleg. When the camera switches from Andre to Wally the color completely changes. It's all grainy as if recorded on bad tape off a badly receiving tv. At one point a little white hair appears and vacillates on the lower screen for oh about 30 minutes. Are they kidding?  There needs to be a new edition of this great movie, and those of us who bought this sham of a version should be allowed to trade it in. Here is a film critiquing the falseness of what our modern life has become: fine, but I don't need an object lesson costing me $20. Out of respect for the sublime Louis Malle, put out a new version!\n"

aS"\nAfter so many years of tentative and superficial studies that barely begin to enter the deep and satisfying world of Wagner's Ring, it's fantastic to read a book that's unafraid to go straight to the bottom of it. Di Gaetani situates the Ring within its entire cultural context, even discussing the gross abuse meted out to it by Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in the classic Looney Tunes cartoon. Common criticisms of the piece revolve around the contention that large stretches of leitmotiv render the piece rather flaccid, making it difficult for Wagner to take the listener to a successful climax. Di Gaetani rips apart these arguments, showing how the sensitive listener can luxuriate in the Ring for the full fifteen hours without it losing its delicate structure. In an epilogue, the author notes the vastly increased freedom that composers have found after being shown the example of Wagner's Ring and the thousands of enthusiastic fans that have spent a lifetime enjoying it. Highly recommended.\n"

aS'\nMany people will look at this film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber\'s classic musical spectacular, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA with mixed emotions.  There are people who will be upset that Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, who played the original Christine and Phantom respectively, were not allowed to recreate their signature roles. There will also be people who\'ll be disappointed that this version is not a literal translation of the stage musical.  Finally, we have the critics of both Webber and director Joel Schumacher, who have both been accused of wretched excess in previous projects in their individual careers.  Taken as a film version however, this PHANTOM stands the test of time, not only as a wonderful musical film, but as one of the more faithful versions of Gaston Laroux\'s romance/horror novel.  \n \n Starting with a black and white prologue, the film tells the story of budding opera star Christine Daae and the two men who fight for her heart: the noble Viscount who she knew in childhood, and the mysterious Phantom of the Paris Opera House who hides his ugliness behind a half-mask while sponsoring Christine\'s career.  Like the stage production, this film is awash in glorious colors and sets that would put many epics to shame. It\'s well balanced by solid performances that help propel the romantic, if melodramatic, story along.  \n \n Gerard Butler makes for a wonderfully dark and obsessive Phantom, while allowing the character to retain the audience\'s sympathy. Miranda Richardson is solid as the dour Madame Giry, who knows the Phantom\'s secret.  Minnie Driver easily gets the most laughs as the over-bearing diva, Carlotta.  (It\'s interesting to note that Ms. Driver\'s singing is dubbed in the film proper, while she actually sings the new closing credits melody "Learn to be Lonely.") Patrick Wilson makes for a stalwart, if somewhat bland, Viscount.  But the strongest impression is made by the lovely Emmy Rossum.  Only in her late teens when filming, she turns in a fantastic performance with a crystal clear voice that does justice to Webber\'s score. Joel Schumacher does a strong enough job in directing this film, allowing the music and the screenplay that he co-wrote with Webber to shine.  \n \n In the end, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a delightful spectacle that does justice in its own way to both the stage original and Laroux\'s book.  As such, this is a film I highly recommend. \n \n'

aS"\nReview updated: July 17, 2009\n \n I don't know what to say...this is a great product!  I remember back in the '80s, we had this crude epilator with a curved rubber tube with tiny slits in it that would open up on the bottom and then close as the tube rotated.  Well, it didn't work worth a crap and it hurt like the devil when it did grab a hair.  So a couple decades later and there's finally a epilator that works the way you'd expect it to.  And the greatest thing is, is that it doesn't hurt in the long run.  It'll hurt a bit at the beginning, especially when you're doing thick patches of hair, but subsequent sessions it actually feels good.  Basically the density of the hairy area you're doing, the more it'll hurt.  Think about it...the more hairs you're pulling out at any given time, the more pain you feel...makes sense, right?  But when you're just going afetr a afew strays or the sporatic regrowth, you'll hardly feel it.\n \n Anyway, here's the deal.  Hair grows in cycles.  Not all hair is above the surface at any given time.  So when you epilate and you think you're smooth, don't be suprised when you find new stubble a day or so later.  But don't worry, that's not hair you missed, that's NEW hair.  Because when you pull it out, it's just as long as the other hair that you pulled out before.  And how long is the hair under your skin?  You'd be amazed.  The pieces I measured were typically 5-6 mm long.  And hair typically grows 1 mm per 5-7 days.  So if you do the math, once your skin is totally epilated, (usually over the course of a week), expect the advertised 3-4 weeks of smooth skin.  And the thing is, is that if you epilate every month or so, over time, your hair will become finer and thinner.  You may even experience total hair loss if and when any given follicle gives up producting hair.  EDIT: I haven't found this to be true yet, but who knows...\n \n The epilator drum or roller is very unique.  It contains 40 metal flaps (tweezers) that move against plastic edges which grabs and pulls out the hairs as the drum rotates away from your skin.  It really doesn't take much of a hair above the surface for the tweezers to work either.  That's probably one of the greatest thing about this epilator.  ie. you don't have to wait days for hair to grow to a certain length to epilate them.  You can do it with 24 hours or so.  \n \n This epilator comes with several different heads and attachements.  It comes with the epilator head with two snap-on attachements that supposedly alleviate the pain for new users.  I found out that the one with the rollers wasn't really necessary.  The advanced user head makes you use the epilator at a 90 degree angle from your skin.  It also helps keep the RPM at a high rate.  But it hinders fine placement in those hard to get areas.  At which point, it's just as well if you don't use an attachment and go with the bare drum.  The other head is a oscilating razor with foil grill as seen in many other razors of this sort these days.  However, being a Braum product, it works really well.  The razor also has a leading trimmer for those long hairs that won't go into the foil.  There's also an attachment that supposedly cuts long hair at the preferred length for optimal epilation.     \n \n The spotlight on the on/off switch is excellent.  It's one of those little LED bulbs that are used in those multi-LED flashlights, so it is pretty bright.  It is kind of necessary in non-flourescent lighting as I notice that if I go outside in sunlight I can see a bunch of hairs (stubble) that I didn't know I had.\n  \n Anyway, if you want the very best of modern epilators, get this one.  It'll save you tons of money in disposable razors and/or waxing.  It'll pay for itself in just one month.  \n \n EDIT: The new Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator  is supposedly more efficient, but it has mixed reviews.  Some say it's wonderful, but others say older models of different brands work better.\n"

aS"\nI will be so bold as to say that I have a great sense of humor. When I first saw this book I thought it would be fantastic to laugh at myself and at recent culture for some of the silly things that we enjoy. Not taking things too seriously can be a very good thing.\n \n But I could not come even close to finishing this book. Klosterman thinks he is cynically hilarious and it's just tacky. He goes on and on and on....... about something so that you forget what the main point is. It's not funny at all. He tries way too hard. I tried to pick out things that I could relate to or would find interesting and nothing helped. I felt like he was the awkward kid in the corner who thinks he's cool, trying to say something that will make everyone laugh but that really you feel sorry for, because he's trying so hard, but you can't help but walk away. \n \n The book came up in conversation with a friend of mine, and I offered for him to read it to see what he thought. Needless to say, I wasn't surprised when he basically threw the book back at me a few days later and said that he could barely get through it and didn't come close to finishing it.\n"

aS'\nThere are already some very well-written informative reviews on this player, so I\'ll try to focus on the "out of the box experience" since mine is literally just out of the box today.  Because my order on Amazon for this product was backordered for a month or more, I called all the local Best Buys until I found a WD TV Live that was not showing up on their "store availability" page and purchased it for $119 plus tax (oh how I missed Amazon when the tax was added on at my local store!).  The price on Amazon has gone all over the place the last few days, from $119 to $149.  I\'m assuming we\'ll see it at $99 after the initial release period is over since several media players are now priced at that point.\n \n I went home, unpacked the box and in my haste I didn\'t even see the installation CD that came with the unit.  (I just ran it now so I could tell you about it - it includes a utility which allows your computer to "see" the WD TV, as well as the manual and some other fluff).\n \n I plugged the WDTV into an ethernet jack on my router, used the supplied cables to attach to my TV, plugged in the power cable and literally minutes later I was watching videos stored on my computer!  The WD TV immediately logged onto our computer network and saw both of our computers (Windows XP), and I was able to watch media stored on both.  Wow.  Very easy.  Then I navigated to Pandora, punched in my account information, and 30 seconds later was listening to my Pandora music stations.  Next stop was YouTube (another menu option), I plugged in my YouTube name and password, and was able to see my YouTube subscriptions.  \n \n I then went into the settings menu and clicked on "update firmware" just to make sure I had the latest firmware installed.  After about 5 seconds of the unit checking with Western Digital, it confirmed my firmware is up to date.  Again, very easy.  I was also able to register the unit from the onscreen display, and received a confirmation email.  I found the onscreen menus very logically laid out and easy to use.\n \n Watching movies stored on my computer and accessing YouTube/Pandora was great - but I wanted to see if I could access Hulu.  So, I navigated to the "media server" menu and it saw my Tversity software program running on one computer.  I clicked on that and minutes later I was watching "Glee" (a program on ABC).  The only issue I ran into was that fast forward would sometimes cause the program to freeze and I would need to re-start.  Given that this media player is brand new and basically in what feels like a beta release, sold out just about everywhere, I\'m assuming that a firmware upgrade in the coming weeks will fix that bug as well as any others I come across.  I tried a few other programs and was only able to replicate the issue intermittently.  However, pause caused no problems.  And, I don\'t expect Western Digital to support Tversity, which may be the root of the problem (vs the WD player) so I\'m not taking off marks for that one issue.  I\'m just happy I can watch a variety of shows streamed from Tversity on the WD TV.  (A google search on Tversity will take you to the download site for that wonderful free to try program).\n \n My previous media server, the D-Link DSM-320 D-Link DSM-320 Wireless Media Player, Audio/Photo/Video, 802.11g , is not nearly as nice... I spent hours and hours and hours (days) configuring it and getting it to "see" my home network.  I also found the user menus to be very cumbersome with navigation almost an afterthought.  In contrast, the WD TV is a dream come true and definitely feels like the "next generation" of media servers.\n \n I\'ve tried a number of video and music formats, and they\'ve all played with no problem (except for the fast forward issue above).  I watched a slide show of pictures stored on one of my computers.  All of this without reading a single manual or going to a single internet help forum.  Literally, plug and play.\n \n So, overall, I\'d say this is a strong unit, and I\'m very happy with it.  Since I am reviewing the unit much sooner than I normally would, I do commit to the Amazon community that if I experience issues with the WD TV I\'ll return to update this review.  But based on my experience with other media servers and other hardware setups, I think this is a winner.  Highly recommended.\n \n Hope this helps!\n \n \n UPDATE 11/12/2009:  Almost a month later and I\'m 1000% happy with this player... no issues.  Works great... fast..great interface... I\'m going to give one or two of these as holiday presents this year.  I\'ve replaced my DVR on my second TV and no longer pay the cable company $14 per month for a DVR... this little gizmo is going to pay for itself!\n \n LAST UPDATE 12/5/2009: I was experiencing video freezing with Hulu using the Tversity software on my computer... I switched to Playon and am really glad I did!  Flawless performance on Hulu streaming and TONS of content (i.e. you can watch tons of old TV shows like Dynasty and Mary Tyler Moore).  Still very happy with this unit.  I do agree with other  reviewers - it would be nice if remote had a volume control, and some of the navigation screens are a bit "clunky" but overall very happy.\n'

aS"\nKlipsch is a recognized high quality name in home theater audio equipment, so I was very excited to receive this package. While, yes, you are not getting a blu-ray player with this system, you could expect to actually spend that $1000 retail price if you decided to purchase a system equal to this with a blu-ray player. As a secondary bedroom or even primary sound system, I found the quality to be superb for the price. \n \n For a sub-$300 2.1 system this little guy really did well competing with our larger more expensive 5.1 Yamaha system. While the Yamaha will beat this system just because 5.1 will always sound better than 2.1, the sound from the speakers were crisper, clearer, and the subwoofer could nearly rattle the walls using it at full power. You still got the feeling of surround sound from this system.\n \n For those who are not technologically inclined, this was not difficult at all to set up. I have had no problems with the DVD player thus far, and Klipsch has noted that they have fixed problems with a previous model. \n \n If you're budget is under $300 and this is a second system for a smaller room or bedroom, I say go for it. If you have more to spend and this is going to be your main theater or living room sound system, I would look for a 5.1 or 7.1 system that you can hook a stand alone blu-ray player into.\n"

aS"\nAvatar is a watershed moment in cinematographic history. It is a step forward as important as the first Star Wars movie was. Avatar is an experience not to be missed by any fan of movies, it is a truly impressive achievement.  I've been a movie fan since the late 1940's, in all that time I had never gone to any movie more than once while it was in it's first run... until Avatar. My wife and I have been to see Avatar three times in theaters (once in each of the three formats: Big screen 3D; IMAX 3D, and big screen 2D. We were favorably impressed by the movie, and the technology, in all three formats. We both felt that Avatar will be remembered as a powerful, ground breaking film, and that it will become a major classic.\n  \n We recently bought the DVD and Blu-Ray two disc combination package (from Amazon.com) and consider the package to be one of the best bargains in entertainment. Getting two and a half hours of entertainment, in two high quality formats, each for the average price of one movie theater ticket is extraordinary... especially when the film is just concluding it's first run in theaters. \n If you can see Avatar on a big screen (in 3D or 2D) by all means do so. I also recommend buying a copy to view at home... the quality and the experience on a good digital TV screen are extraordinary. This film is one that will influence the making of, and course of,  film entertainment for a long time to come.\n"

aS'\nAfter trudging through imitations and poor sequels, I was thrilled when Puzzle Quest 2 finally arrived.  I didn\'t think you could improve the game play but somehow, Infinite Interactive did, with a new cleaner way to handle spells and weapons.  As you "walk" through the town, you feel more a part of the story than in Puzzle Quest 1 and this enhances the battles, as winning becomes more personal and important. This game requires more thought than quick reflexes, which allows the player to take the time to make considered decisions as you ponder which spell, weapon, and gem-match will benefit you most. With a clever mix of role play, magic and matching, I foresee hours of game-play and real enjoyment for most any age and every skill level.\n'

aS"\nIn this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of 1988, Toni Morrison frees herself from the bonds of traditional narrative and establishes an independent style, just as her characters have freed themselves from the horrors of slavery and escaped from Kentucky to Ohio.  Revealing the story of Sethe and her family as they survive the brutality of the farm, only to encounter torments even more punishing than whippings after they escape, Morrison presents scenes in a seemingly random order, each scene revealing some aspect of life for Sethe, her boys, her dead baby Beloved, and the new baby Denver, both in the past and in the present.  Moving back and forth, around, and inside out through Sethe's recollections, she gradually reveals Sethe's story to the reader, its horror increasing as the reader makes the connections which turn disconnected scenes into a powerful and harrowing chronology. \n \n As the novel opens, Sethe and Denver have lived in #124, a house in Ohio, for eighteen years, refusing to socialize and enjoying no company.  When Paul D. Garner, one of the Sweet Home men and a friend of her long-missing husband, arrives on her doorstep and moves in, Sethe slowly reveals her long-buried nightmares, and the two share their stories of the events leading up to their escape.  Most haunting to Sethe is the death of her young daughter Beloved, shortly after the escape from the farm, though the reader does not know for many pages the shocking manner of her death.  When a ghostly figure who calls herself Beloved arrives at #124, shortly after Paul D., Morrison creates mystery and a heart-stoppingly tense atmosphere when Beloved moves in.  As Beloved gradually takes over the household and seems to demand and then possess Sethe's soul, the sorrow which has burdened Sethe seems close to breaking her.\n \n The sadism of some slave-owners, the devices used to torture, and the desperate measures some slaves took to protect themselves and their loved ones come fully alive here, the horrors growing as the reader gradually discovers the real source of Sethe's torment. By forcing the reader to make the connections, instead of spelling out details in a traditional narrative, Morrison strengthens the impact of the novel and its brutal revelations.  Symbols of water, rain, snow, and ice connect the disparate scenes, and the use of shadows and the ghostly character of Beloved keep the reader on tenterhooks until the action is eventually resolved.  A powerful, atmospheric, and shocking novel, Beloved is also a searing indictment of slavery and the damage it has done to the fabric of life, damage that cannot be repaired until it is fully recognized through novels such as this. n Mary Whipple\n \n"

aS"\nI've been using Alli now since the middle of November, and I've lost 12 pounds, on schedule with the promised 1-2 pounds of safe weight loss per week.  They have a very robust online support site for people who purchase the pills and it provides useful tracking of weight loss and encouragement in more ways than I can use.  The treatment effects that you read about are what keeps people honest with Alli and essentially make it work -- if you eat too much fat at one sitting, you'll be visiting the bathroom quite frequently.  You learn quick.  I made it through the holidays with continued weight loss, which I view as an amazing feat.  I have 13 more pounds to lose on my plan and I'll weigh what I did before I had my two kids.  Easy to use, promotes healthy eating habits and lifestyle changes, and self-critiquing when you stray from the plan.  I would recommend Alli to others -- it's a little pricy but I'm getting my money's worth out of it.\n"

aS'\nI told everyone I bought this large beach-ball sprinkler for grandson Devon, but I really bought it for myself. It looked like a fun, cool thing to have during these 106 temps we\'ve been suffering ... and I liked the looks of it. I challenge anyone to look at a beach-ball without thinking of surf-and-turf and happy, fun-filled days of summers past. My mind rocks back to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk and the Beach Boys. ... Ah-hhh ... "California Girls," "Good Vibrations," "Surfing U.S.A" ... Who could ever forget those and other big hits they performed?\n \n Devon was drawn to the sprinkler--as people have always migrated to water--and he liked it for about a California minute ... until the sprinklers squirted him directly in the face with mini-force. He enjoyed getting wet, of course, but didn\'t like the water in his eyes. Besides, he wanted the ball for himself; HIS toy, you know. So, being a smart kid, he crawled beneath the water-streams and kept trying to roll it. That, in itself was amusing to us adults, but frustrating for him.\n \n As a result, because I think it\'s pretty, I now use it as a yard decoration ... but only when Devon is inside looking out. And when he\'s napping, I still "run through the sprinkler" from time to time. Just a big kid at heart.\n \n This isn\'t an educational toy (nor does anyone claim it to be); it\'s more durable than the usual beach-ball; and I think it\'s tons of fun. Even if it\'s not for Devon--after all, he\'s only one-and-a-half--it makes ME happy. When not outdoors, I enjoy standing at my upstairs window, looking down on it, while imagining myself standing in the silver jets of water as they cool me off while the colors appeal to my sense of harmony. As I said, it\'s cool ... in more ways than one!\n \n To each his own, but I think you\'ll enjoy it too.\n \n Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008\n Author of: The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley\n \n \n'

aS'\nI had been looking at the various netbooks for a while and really liked Toshiba\'s NB205 but just couldn\'t get around the negative comments on battery placement and speaker quality.  The NB305 was specifically designed to address these concerns - different battery placement and two speakers instead of just the one on the 205.  \n \n As for things this shares with the 205:  The chiklet keyboard just rocks - space between the keys goes a long way towards cutting down on the mistypes that you get on the keyboards where the keys are merging one into the next.  It may not matter to many people but if you have a long haired cat or dog that sheds and likes to spend time in your lap the fact that this is a much easier keyboard to keep pet hair out of is a huge plus as well.  Having two separate mouse buttons instead of one rocker bar is handy for those of us who like to actually use the right click.  Keyboard layout as a whole is very "touch type" friendly so those who actually learned how to type on a real keyboard or -gasp- typewriter can actually use this keyboard.  Portability is also another huge plus, when it\'s closed this little guy doesn\'t have much more of a footprint than a decent sized hard cover book and while I realize that this just means it\'s a netbook as somebody who still remembers his high school computer lab having IBM PS-2\'s it\'s still amazing.\n \n In an effort to make this a true review I\'ll also hit a few of the things that are shortcomings for the NB305.  Is this going to let you watch high def movies - no.  Is this going to let you play World of Warcraft or other graphic intensive games - no.  Are you going to be able to multi-task 5 different RAM intensive applications - be serious you only have 1G of RAM or 2G if you upgrade.  \n \n The reason I\'m giving such a great rating to this netbook is that having said all of the things that the NB305 - and for that matter netbooks in general - can\'t do the simple fact is that I don\'t want to do and wouldn\'t expect to do those things on a 10.1 in screen to begin with.  If you want to play games there are laptops targeted for that market, if you want to watch HD video get a laptop with a blue-ray not something that doesn\'t even have an optical media drive.  You can get a laptop that plays games - full discloser I have one, handles HD video and/or serves as near "desk top replacements" and you can get them for not a lot more than you will spend to get the NB305, what you will not get is the portability.  Personally I want something to check my email, check headlines on the web, watch the occasional You-Tube, do word processing, handle I-Tunes and allow me to use a Citrix client to access the work related apps on a server when I\'m away from the office and still fit in my briefcase.  This little guy fits the bill and looks good doing it - thanks Toshiba.\n'

aS'\nThis is one of those rare books that makes me realize how grateful I am that I enjoy reading and am given the gift of being able to slip into someone else\'s story and experience what they do through the written word.\n \n As other reviewers have noted: this is the story of a young woman who discovers that she can taste other people\'s deepest emotions and secrets through the food that they prepare. It changes her perspective on the world and while there is no "revolution of action" for her (meaning she doesn\'t harness the power to make a global impact or anything quite as grand) her perceptions and reactions are honest and breathtaking.\n \n I\'m not a huge fan of "magic realism" books because I find they tend to tilt towards overblown fairy-tale instead of moments of enchantment which enrich the story, but "The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake" is a perfect balance. Even the strange story of Rose\'s brother adds to the story, although there was a chapter I had to read several times to wrap my brain around.\n \n While I do recommend this book, it\'s NOT for people who find untraditional narrative unappealing. For instance, there is not a *single* quotation mark in the entire book. There is little deliniation between throught and spoken word/conversation. At first, I thought "I can\'t read this..." but within a page or two, I fell right into Rose\'s perspective and the book just flowed.\n \n I really loved reading this book. While there were sad moments, I never once felt like chucking the book across the room, which I get the urge to do when other books get overwhelmingly depressing (usually for the sake of packing an emotional punch). "The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake" kept me enchanted and locked in its story until the last page. And then I insisted my husband read it, which I rarely do. \n \n Great book.\n'

aS"\nLet's just say that Amazon is AWESOME!! Instead of paying over 150 dollars for shipping and over a hundred for tax, this was worth every penny! Assembly was really simple except for the seat bar, you almost need two people for that one to balance it out...but I got it on with some patience. Everything was easy to put together and the machine looks incredible!\n \n Now I have worked out on free weights for over 8 years now, getting the Bowflex was a big step for me, but I wanted a gym at home instead of joining a gym and wasting money on membership fees and having to wait in line for the weight area to become free. The first exercise I did was bench press, I was immediately impressed by how great the machine made my muscles contract. My arms shook a lot in the beginning probably because I was not used to doing bench press without a bar, but I got down to the rhythm of it in just a few repetitions. After using the machine and getting an amazing ab workout, I woke up this morning feeling like a truck hit me...which is exactly how I like to feel the morning after a good workout! Sore is a good sign that the machine works! My max on bench press is 275 pounds and 285 on decline, so for a machine that has a max weight of 210 pounds to give me a great workout is just what I was looking for.\n \n I would recommend this machine to anyone because 1.) The price you can not beat with free shipping and no tax 2.) It works your body just like free weights do 3.) You will probably spend the same amount that you pay for this thing over a two year period with a gym that does not belong to you at all 4.) MOST IMPORTANTLY!!! You can work out at home ANYTIME you want and not have to worry about how you look, the weather or the extra expense of driving all the way over there! I think this is a great product, and so far it has made my entire body sore, exactly what I was looking for. I hope the review helps :-).\n"

aS"\nWhen I dislike a book, I often don't dwell on it, because what's the point, right? But my reaction to this book went BEYOND dislike, and I felt I had to vent about it a little bit to get it out of my system. \n \n This book was horrible. Absolutely horrible. I bought it because it was featured in a magazine I read, and I'd heard good things about it, so I decided to give it a try...as a die-hard fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and fantasy literature in general, I thought it was right up my alley. I was wrong.\n \n First of all, I was *disgusted* by the main characters. I actually think one can dislike a character and still like the book/writing, but in this case, the main characters were pathetic and boring. The female lead (Bella Swan. Really. Bella Swan. Why not just call her Pretty McPerfect and have done with it?) is completely vapid. She has no goals, no dreams, no ambition, no personality aside from being miserable and obsessed with her boyfriend. Now, ok, it's romance. Fine. But romance can be accomplished...and often in a better way...if the participants have strong, defining character traits. It heightens the tension and makes the results much more satisfying. Bella had no defining character traits. I don't even remember what she was supposed to look like. She was selfish and misanthropic for absolutely no reason, and she acted like a spoiled martyr for far too many pages. It's really quite depressing that this book is being touted for teenage girls, because the main character is a HORRIBLE role model in every sense of the word. Why not portray her as having goals? Dreams? Ambitions? It would serve to heighten the conflict and make the book better in the long run.\n \n But anyway. The love interest, superhot vampire Edward, is downright scary. And not in like...the good way. He stalks her. He makes decisions for her. He doesn't listen to her views or opinions (not that she has any, really). He encourages her to lie. He puts her in danger...no matter how many times he whines about the emotional toll it puts on him, he still doesn't stop putting her in danger. He is cruel and arrogant. AND SHE ACCEPTS THIS! He keeps telling her how she needs him to look after her, how she would die or something if it wasn't for him. AND SHE IS NOT OFFENDED/ANNOYED BY THIS. Seriously! Even the most ambivalent feminist should find this insulting and derogatory! \n \n There's absolutely no chemistry between the leads. She loves him because he is beautiful. He loves her because he wants to eat her and she smells good. Really. He tells her she is like his heroin. How is that in anyway healthy? She is willing to die for someone she barely knows, someone who plays mind games with her, who dominates her completely. She admits to being completely obsessed with him. And there are no consequences for this! She has no doubts about her emotions toward him!\n \n Ugh. I could go on, but I won't. I just want to say that this is probably the worst book I have ever read, and I'm not too far removed from the teen audience this book is geared to. I see no redeeming features at ALL, except perhaps the character Jacob, who seems like the only person in this entire book that has any interesting and healthy character traits. But now that I've gotten this out of my system, I do feel better. \n \n In short...please don't read this book. Please.\n"

aS'\n*****\n Geneen Roth hits a home run with her latest book about overeating and so much more in "Women Food and God". The theme of the book is that the way we eat, the way we think about food and handle ourselves around it is the way we do everything. The author then shows us how and why this is the case. She describes the food retreats she runs and the women who attend them, and as a reader you will surely identify in some way with every single person--and with the lesson she illustrates from their lives. This is a more complex book than her earlier books because of the spiritual dimension; she sees problems with overeating as gateways to spiritual enlightenment. She convinced me (and will convince you as well) that instead of trying to get rid of or fix our eating problems, we need to use them to see within ourselves, to learn important spiritual life lessons from our feelings, and to grow and heal so that we will end up eating as a spiritual practice. And so that we\'ll have a permanent end to the misery of always struggling with our weight and self-image, and always striving to improve our relationship with food. \n \n The book is so good that for me, just reading it was like a spiritual awakening in this area of my life. I found it motivational, inspirational, and scary in a good way--and the author makes the whole process doable with descriptions of practices that can be used on the food healing/awakening journey such as meditation, inquiry, and eating guidelines. These practices are all specific to the process and they are described in detail. This spiritual dimension is generic and does not require a particular religious belief, or even any religious belief. It would be compatible with any type of spirituality. The type of eating practiced is intuitive eating (listening to your body to discern what it wants), and no matter what your way of eating, you can apply an intuitive approach to it--this book is about a way of living and relating to food, not about a food plan.\n \n If you have read the author\'s other books (as I have) you will find much new information here. Other key themes of the book include mindfulness, presence, and feeling your feelings. The author is brutal but honest in describing how destructive the dieting industry is to women. Again, this is definitely not a diet book or eating plan, but instead a way of experiencing life which allows you to be present and aware so that you are able to listen to your body and choose food based on nourishment and self-care. \n \n Although it is a quick read (I read it in one evening), this book is so valuable that you will want to refer back to it, highlight it for future reference, take notes in the margins, and use parts for journal prompts. There is only one negative, and it is a biggy: the paper in this hardback book is similar to super cheap mass market paperback-type paper. I have never seen an actual book of any type with such paper, though! I tried to highlight sections and the highlighter not only would bleed through to the reverse side of the page, but sometimes onto the previous page! It is hard to describe how frustrating this was---a book that is a true keeper on throw-away paper. I highlighted anyway and my book is a mess, but I decided to rebuy it on Kindle when it comes out. I\'ve never done this before, but it\'s that good of a book--worth months (or maybe years) of therapy. I also would buy it again if it is reprinted (and I\'ll bet it will be) with a paper that matches the quality of the book. \n \n That flaw aside, I\'m so glad I bought this book. I have read many, many books on overeating, diet and nutrition, self-help, styles of eating, and more, and this book stands apart from the crowd. The message is an important one for any woman who wants to handle her relationship with food, her weight, and her spirituality in a healthy way, and to become whole. If that is you, you will not be disappointed, I promise.\n \n Highest recommendation.\n *****\n'

aS'\nKevin Smith\'s first directing gig that he didn\'t write himself, "Cop Out," finds the director re-teaming with his Live Free or Die Hard  co-star, Bruce Willis, as well as Tracy Morgan and Seann William Scott, who were both featured in his 2001 film and quite possibly the biggest inside-joke put to film, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back .\n \n More than that, though, the film is a brilliant throwback to the glory days of such 80\'s buddy cop franchises as Lethal Weapon  and Beverly Hills Cop . You\'ll recognize key dialog from the former while the composer for the latter, Harold Faltermeyer, makes a glorious return to the genre with a quirky retro score that sets the mood just right. Bruce Willis plays the straight-man to Tracy Morgan\'s...well...Tracy Morgan is really just playing every character he\'s ever played here, but the way in which he bounces off of Willis (who himself seems to be trying hard to keep a straight face in many scenes) keeps it from feeling tired or stale. While this odd-couple/cop formula has been done to death in the past, it works for this film and is done in a loving way that pays tribute rather than re-hashes.\n \n Smith, whose films are mostly talk, proves himself to be a competent action director at times throughout the film. It\'s funny to think that the man who made Clerks  made a polished studio film such as this, but it\'s a sign of maturity more than selling-out, so rest easy fanboys. The script by Mark & Robb Cullen is whip-smart, witty and never leaves you longing for a laugh. Even if you don\'t gel with the story about a rare baseball card landing into the lap of a high-powered drug-lord, you\'ll always find yourself laughing along with the film. It also helps, too, that each and every player seems to have had a good time making the film, and that translates into the final result.\n \n One could make the argument that Smith himself could have re-written the film and made it all the funnier, but much of the humor in the film comes from the on-screen chemistry. It\'s about as good of an 80\'s buddy cop throwback as you\'ll get, and is rounded out with a brilliant cast that also includes Guillermo Diaz, Kevin Pollak, Adam Brody and Jason Lee, among others. Go into expecting a simple yet effective way of just how fun an action movie can be. As for Smith, he\'s shown significant range, and hopefully the film will help break him out from just being the guy who directed those Jay & Silent Bob flicks. Thankfully, "Cop Out" is anything but.\n'

aS'\nI\'m not a gamer, just a regular 30something who wants an easy way to take out my frustrations.  This review is probably most helpful to middle aged men like me, not hardcore gamers.  \n \n I have tried many other games but Halo is the only one that doesn\'t tax me too much with choices and complicated controller requirements.  I give the Halo franchise 5 stars because it is so simple, one mission, kill everything in sight.  You don\'t need to investigate, open your pouch, choose between a million weapons, read maps, or think for even a second. It\'s the only game I\'ve found which I can stand for more than 5 minutes and which is completely uncomplicated. And you can skip the story and all that nonsense by just hitting the main button.  \n \n As compared to other Halos:  I\'m not crazy about the weaponry.  The needlers run out of ammo and the other guns don\'t do much. You also need to press a button to reload some weapons, it seems, whereas before they would reload if you walked over the same kind of weapon.  THere are 3 kinds of grenades, which is unnecessary and just harder to switch between.  You can also only carry 2 of each instead of 4.  Since the new grenades stick like the plasmas, they don\'t add much and just add another layer of choice and button-pushing.  Too complicated.  Also, the little bonus things like flares and landmines are gimmicky and add too much comlpication.  Again, advanced gamers probably love it, but I\'m too old to learn all this new stuff.  Just give me a gun and some grenades.  \n \n In previous games you\'d come across more types of things to do, like a lot of sniper rifles so you could sit on a hilltop picking off aliens or use other strategy.  In this game you don\'t find a lot of useful weapons, so there\'s a lot more direct hand to hand, on the ground type combat.  I\'ve also found that it\'s easier to kill things and easier in general to solve the levels.  Also, it uses the "follow me" arrow and the voice gives you suggestions if you seem to be missing the point, which I like, since in previous Halos I\'ve spent hours wandering around wondering what I\'m supposed to be doing.  No such problems here.  They\'ve sufficiently dumbed it down.  \n \n I\'ve had a few graphic glitches in this one, which has never happened before.  I\'ve also gotten stuck and unable to get out of things twice.  THe sound and graphics are great, of course. I\'ve never paid any attention to the story, unless it required me to, so I can\'t comment on that.  Kusdos to Bungie for making it easy to skip over.  \n \n Overall, this is the same experience as the others, though it seems easier than Halo2.  As little thought as that required, this one requires less. I\'ve not had to think at all about weapon choice, strategy, or anything,  Just pull the trigger and kill!  I wish there were more FPS games like this -- fast-paced, completely intuitive hand controls, easy storyline, simple mission, and FUN.\n'

aS"\nOk here we go for my first and probably only review on Amazon. I am 50 years old and have tried pretty much every electric shaver known to mankind. Each time giving up due to  the pinching,non close shave and pain in the butt cleaning. In the end, I was going back to razor blades and the frequent cuts. I went to Braun's website and read about this shaver and came to Amazon to see the reviews here. I decided after reading the reviews to splurge on another electric shaver.\n What a find! This in my humble opinion is the greatest invention EVER! It's the first electric razor I've used which doesn't get hot after a couple minutes of use.Hot razor means sweaty face which trips up razor and adds to pinching. Braun recommends you shave before you shower or wash your face, while you still have a little protective barrier of oil on your skin. A big no-no with regular shaving, this worked well with the Pulsonic. They also recommend you shave against the grain. Again, not recommended for regular shaving. For electric shaving, works great.\n \n I must say I Absolutely LOVE shaving now.(I would let my beard grow for days because I HATED shaving with razors and cutting myself). The Pulsonic is the closest shave ever by an electric razor(IMHO shaves as close as a razor once you master it) and more importantly it does not pinch or burn at all. Even better is the self cleaning which make life easier.\n My wife laughs every morning as she now sees me shaving daily with this god send! if you are reading bad reviews on this product it must be I just don't get it.\n Bottom line:  BUY THIS NOW! I just ordered another one for my son!\n I am telling all who read this if you hate shaving GET THIS PRODUCT you will love it.\n"

aS'\n&quot;It is a sin to kill a mockingbird.&quot;  This book is about  justice, and conscience... it is about race, and bigotry... it is about  courage, and cowardice... it is about values of the family, and the culture...  it is about humanity.   The novel speaks through the 8-year-old voice of  Scout Finch, the youngest child of a widower, Atticus Finch.  There are two  stories being told.  One story is about Scout, her older brother Jem and  their summertime friend Dill Harris as they pass three summers together in  a small town in Alabama, when they focused much of their energy on a  reclusive, neighbor, Boo Radley.  The other story is about the trial of Tom  Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman in 1930\'s Alabama.   Atticus is appointed to represent the accused.  The seamless writing brings  both stories together in perfect accord by the conclusion. At first it  would seem unbelievable that "To Kill a Mockingbird" was written by a  Southern author, but upon reflection, it could have only been written by  someone from the South.  Harper Lee had one incredible story to tell and  she told it well.  Don\'t read this novel for inventiveness.  Read it for  the near perfect writing.  Read it to be moved.  Read "To Kill a  Mockingbird" because it is a sin not to.\n'

aS"\nFirst, this album is a work of genius. Second, here is why you should buy it. &quot;Either/Or&quot; is Elliot's 3rd solo release, following 3 albums and several EPs with the Portland indie/grunge band Heatmiser. I can't speak for &quot;roman candle&quot; or &quot;Elliot Smith,&quot; but i can tell you about this album...which is one of the best i have ever heard.  As several other reviews said, this album has an ethereal, acoustic sound, best compared to Simon and Garfunkel or Nick Drake. The songs - short, but beautiful - are vintage Elliot, with moody, depressing lyrics generally about the girl who got away - and why it's his own fault. &quot;Nobody broke your heart...you broke your own cuz you can't finish what you start,&quot; he chants over and over on &quot;Alameda.&quot; Elliot utilizes both complex, Dylanesque lines along with simple, powerful phrases like the chorus of &quot;Ballad of Big Nothing&quot; to create truly moving songs...and if that's not enough, Elliot is a fine singer.  The highlight of many songs is the vocal melody, especially on the bright &quot;Rose Parade.&quot; Elliot's trademarke guitar work is here, of course - his pick/strum chord-oriented songs comprise the bulk of the album. The music stands on it's own, yet creates a suberb backing for Elliot's singing and lyrics. This is one of his best albums, and i would consider it stronger than XO, which has been more universally acclaimed (even by this website!). A few standout tracks - of course, the songs from Good Will Hunting... &quot;Ballad of Big Nothing&quot; &quot;Say Yes&quot; and &quot;Between the Bars.&quot; The entire album is great, however, with not a single weak track.  You should pick this one up - everyone should give &quot;Either/Or&quot; a chance, because someday it will stand as one of the finest albums produced during the 1990's...and maybe ever.\n"

aS"\nIt is a tiny camcorder.  It will easily fit inside cargo, jacket or baggy pockets.  Of course with the extremely small size comes some limitations.  This camera is not going to have the same picture quality as professional HD camcorders. But that said it is a very nice camera for shooting standard definition home movies.  It has an excellent zoom. The battery and built in memory are going to give you about 3 1/2 hours of recording time.  As for all the people who are complaining about trying to edit the footage (that is because they are not using Macs.)  If you have an up to date Mac it is a breeze.    \n \n I have an Intel Mac.  I convert the footage with MPEG Streamclip (Which you can download for free at the Apple Web site.)  And then it works fine with Final Cut Pro 6.  I convert it to Quicktime and then choose the DV setting.  It works great.  It also works just fine without MPEG Streamclip if you are using iMovie 08'.    The whole process is quick and painless.  No going through the whole tape to log and capture the footage.  So If you are looking for a tiny SD camcorder that you can take anywhere and edit it with newer Intel Macs, this is a great choice.  I think you will enjoy this camera.\n"

aS'\nWith three little ones in the house its hard to catch anything on tv that isn\'t a cartoon.  My husband and I are hooked on this reality show which is still on TLC.  Once you start watching it you want to see more. You can learn so much from the Roloff family.  I have been waiting for them to come out with these DVD\'s by season.  I\'m excited to see they are putting out season one and hope that they continue release all of the seasons here on after.  I plan on introducing this program to my children as they get older (my oldest is 6).   You get a better understanding of what "little people" go through in our big world.  It\'s really neat watching all of the Roloff children grow up.    You won\'t regret it pre-order your DVD today!\n'

aS'\nI\'m happy with this bundle. I ordered it when I saw it, and it came quicker than expected. I told my husband his birthday present might be a day or two late and it arrived the day before his birthday.\n \n Setting up the system was easy and quick for him, and he was happy that the hdmi cable was included. He doesn\'t always trust me to order games or game systems for him.\n The game included wasn\'t to his tastes, but honestly? I don\'t recall a single time we ever got a bundle that included a game he was interested in. What made this bundle a winner for me was that it IS a game my teenage daughter was interested in. She\'s been having a blast with it. I told him what I was getting him for his birthday so if he wanted any particular game he could get it for himself. I also did order Final Fantasy XIII when it came up as a Gold Box deal recently. \n He put on a movie to see the quality of movie playback on the machine and we were all very happy with that. \n As a non-gamer looking for a good present for a husband who does like console games and for something my teens would like, this is a good deal. Everyone is very happy with it for movie playback, my daughter loves Little Big Planet and visually as a crafter, I love the look of Little Big Planet. Lots of great inspiration in the colors and shapes in the game.\n As far as stars go, I asked my husband and daughter. He rated the bundle as very good for the system and hdmi cable. When I asked my daughter about the game, she said it was one of her favorites that she ever played. "It\'s very fun!"\n'

aS"\nI've been using Dremels for a long time and always wanted a decent cordless.  With the advent of decent cordless power tools (the first one that I had that was actually  useful for something was an 18 volt DeWalt drill that went right through stuff my corded drills wouldn't touch, but that's another story) I've been waiting for Dremel to come out with a good cordless. I've been hesitant about the earlier cordless Dremels but this one looks like &quot;it&quot;. So far it's done everything I've asked it to do but I haven't asked it to do much--I got it specifically to deal with a piece of acrylic that my cordless Rotozip melted instead of cutting--I figured the adjustable speed on the Dremel would take care of that and was right. Just an aside about stalling--if you're stalling a Dremel then it's time to take a good hard look at a Rotozip, which, if you've never played with one, is kind of a Dremel on steroids--Dremel has an equivalent, the &quot;Advantage&quot;, but only the one model and not cordless. The lack of a provision to charge the battery with the tool attached is just carrying through the current practice with cordless tools--it's assumed that one will have two batteries, one on the tool and one on charge if this is an issue.  There's space in the case for a second battery. A &quot;gotcha&quot; to be aware of with the lithium ion batteries, always store them charged--if they self-discharge below a certain point a protective circuit kicks in and they disable themselves--this is a safety issue--trying to recharge a lithium ion battery that is discharged below a certain point can result in an explosion (I'm not talking about a little spill--exploding lithium batteries in emergency-locator transmitters have brought down light aircraft). The bundled accessories are, near as I can figure it: Aluminum oxide stone #932 and #8193 Silicon carbide stone #84922 Aluminum oxide abrasive wheel #541 2 rubber polishing wheels #425 3 Large felt polishing wheels #429 5 Small felt polishing wheels #414 1 cutter, looks like a #181 1 drill bit, #150 1 Mandrel #401 (for felt pads etc) 1 Mandrel #402 (for sanding disks, cutoff wheels etc) Sanding cylinder mandrels 1/4&quot; and 1/2&quot; 4 80 grit 1/2&quot; sanding cylinders 3 120 grit 1/2&quot; sanding cylinders 4 80 grit 1/4&quot; sanding cylinders 3 120 grit 1/4&quot; sanding cylinders 11 sanding disks 17 cutoff wheels, 3 are thicker than the others, the others are in two containers of 10 and 4 but can't tell any difference between them. 1 wrench with screwdriver tip that fits screws on mandrels 1 case with a good deal of unused storage even after all the accessories are stored.\n"

aS'\nTo start, I\'ve used whitening strips before.  And they\'ve always worked very well on me.  I never had any sensitivity to any sort of strip, so, I was confident that Crest\'s newest 3D whitening strips would be fine for me.  And they were!  \n \n After just 3 days of using the strips, I noticed a dramatic difference in the color of my coffee-stained teeth!  I noticed the change in color both in person, as well as in photographs of myself.  After 10 days, my teeth were glowing white - not so white that you\'d think they were fake, just a nice, healthy white smile! \n \n I have nothing but great things to say about Crest\'s 3D Whitestrips!  The "advanced seal" is amazing - no more goopy strips that feel like they are slipping everywhere in your mouth!  These strips are going to be my go-to strips every six months now!  These are fantastic!\n'

aS'\nLet me get this out of the way first. \n And I have a feeling many of you will laugh when you read this. \n But....I have never read the original story. \n All I knew was some girl named Alice fell down a hole and met a bunch of strange characters and that\'s about it. \n Honestly? \n I think that gave me an advantage to actually watch the film without expecting things to go a certain way. \n I know a lot of critics are saying this version is too much like "Lord of the Rings". \n I can\'t say if that\'s accurate or not but the ending hardly reminded me of anything out of "Lord of the Rings". \n I was scared, I mean REALLY scared that Burton, even with Depp and the rest of the cast wouldn\'t be able to pull this off. \n I was scared right in the beginning that the film would rapidly dissolve into something so bad and so corny it would be painful to watch. \n It didn\'t. \n In a sea of weird movies, this one has to be Burton\'s crowing jewel of weirdness. \n If you thought "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was weird, you haven\'t seen ANYTHING. \n This movie ups the weirdness factor by 100. \n Is that a good thing? \n It depends..... \n Did you like "Charlie"? If the answer is yes, than you\'ll probably like this. \n I liked "Charlie" but I though this was a hundred times weirder and better. \n \n Ok...."Alice in Wonderland". \n What was good? \n Masterfull acting from Depp, Carter, and Hathaway. \n Burton\'s most visually stunning movie ever. \n Great score. \n The film was paced well and wasn\'t a second too long or too short. \n I know a lot of people were worried that the CGI would ruin the movie. It didn\'t, it blends seamlessly with the human actors into a film quite like no other. Some may say Avatar, but I haven\'t seen that yet so I really can\'t compare. \n \n What was bad? \n There really wasn\'t a whole lot of story to be had here. \n It had A story just not a very deep one. \n What little story was there was good and it wrapped up very nicely. \n I\'m knocking one star off due to lack of a more in depth story. \n But considering I never knew what the original story was to begin with I really can\'t complain. \n \n Let\'s sum it up. \n Burton\'s most visually stunning film ever. \n The entire cast is amazingly good. \n Everything is perfect in every way except the story could have used a little more work. \n I saw the movie in 2D not 3D but I loved the 2D version. I may or may not go see it again in 3D but I\'m anxious to read what others say about the 3D version. \n All in all, \n "Alice in Wonderland" comes.... \n Highly Recommended!!!\n'

aS"\nI got this book because I wanted something that I could use to help teach my son his ABC's.  I bought it when he was about 15 months and immediately he enjoyed the book.  We would sing the song, read through the entire book, I'd point out the letters etc.  I find this book a very helpful starting point for learning the alphabet, a fun way!  One idea for younger toddlers, when I started we'd just read the letter and skip the other info on the page.  This way the book was more managable for my toddlers short attention span.  I have to say though, he really likes this book. Esp. when we first got it he'd literally sit down with the book and just flip through the pages.  A++\n"

aS'\n"Anne of Avonlea" is a brilliant companion to the original "Anne of Green Gables."  This sequel combines the next THREE novels in the series --- "Anne of Avonlea," "Anne of the Island," and "Anne of Windy Poplars."  Several characters are combined to make ONE specific character, but the story still remains very much Anne\'s story.\n \n Now a little older, having taught at the public school in Avonlea for a while, Anne decides to try her hand at teaching at a private school in Kingsport --- a wealthy town mainly run by a particular set, the Pringles.  It\'s a new and daunting experience --- especially considering that she can\'t seem to win over the students or the school board --- but her stubbornnes won\'t allow her to give up, and she charges forward with her usual determination.\n \n There are several new characters, but we still have appearances by the old ones.  We meet Morgan Harris, his intelligent daughter Emmeline, his mother and his sister, and of course we meet countless girls who go to Kingsport Ladies College.  But Rachel Lynde and Marilla Cuthbert are still around, Diana Barry remains a wonderful friend, and of course there is the wonderful Gilbert Blythe --- more in love with Anne than ever.\n \n This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen, it fits perfectly with the original movie and does a decent job of remaining as faithful as possible to the books, in spite of everything that was altered.  I love this movie.  To this day, my family occasionally has "Anne Weekends," in which we watch "Anne of Green Gables" one night and "Anne of Avonlea" the next!\n'

aS'\nI have recently decided that home workouts are the only way I am going to ensure I get a workout in every day, with a toddler and a full time job. Thus, I did a lot of research on good DVDs and some essential "props" and over the past few months have purchased about 12 DVDs from TaeBo to PIlates to the Biggest Loser series, and then I saw this new one from Jillian, and it surpassed everything else I own by far. I have been working out pretty regularly for over 10 years, I\'ve done triathlon\'s and everything from spinning to running to kickboxing, so I figured I could start at Level 3. After 3 minutes I went down to Level 2, and then another five minutes to Level 1!!! I have been doing Level 1 for a week and think I will be able to progress a level each week, but it is truly a challenging and rewarding workout, and I highly recommend it for people who enjoy maximum results in minimal time (and don\'t mind sweating and feel like they might have a heart attack!)\n'

aS"\nI had read and enjoyed Haruki Murakami's tetralogy (Hear the Wind Sing, Pinball, A Wild Sheep Chase, and Dance Dance Dance), and I loved his Wind-Up Bird Chronicle novel, but I was ready for something new.  In reviews and on websites, I had read over and over about Norwegian Wood, the &quot;straightforward&quot; novel that was published years ago in Japan, which still was not for sale in the states, since there was not an authorized translation available. This novel sold a HUGE number of copies in Japan. I was wondering: I love those other novels by Murakami. Are they so demanding? Complicated? If Norwegian Wood is so much simpler than the other novels, will I even like Norwegian Wood? The plot: It's the late 1960's. College student Toru falls in love with the girlfriend of his (dead) best friend. She eventually becomes ill (though not physically ill) and has to leave to live under special circumstances, far away from him. While she's gone, he meets Midori, a college student who obviously is interested in him. But he's holding out for his girlfriend Naoko. Never knowing if she will recover from her ailment and be able to rejoin him in society, he goes to classes, sells phonograph records at night, and spends some time with Midori. He visits Naoko a few times, gets to know her wacky roommate/friend/mentor Reiki, and eventually he has to decide between a life with Naoko (without Naoko?) or with Midori. Throw in a bizarre Geography-major roommate nicknamed &quot;Storm Trooper,&quot; a scene where Midori (badly) sings folk songs to our Toru while they watch a neighborhood fire from the balcony above her parents' bookshop, and assorted other hilarious/bizarre characters and passages, and you've got vintage Haruki Murakami. My favorite scene is one in which Midori takes Toru to visit her ill father in the hospital. He's so ill he can barely eat or speak, but Toru convinces Midori to enjoy a respite, and take a walk by herself out to a park in town. Toru is left alone with this bedridden stranger, in a situation that would seem forced, harsh, and impossible to enjoy, yet they make some very odd and touching inroads with each other. It's very unusual, and perfect in just the way that so many of Murakami's scenes seem to be. The novel isn't as complex as Haruki's other work, and it's missing some of the magical realist / sci-fi / unexplainable elements that were so prevalent in Dance Dance Dance, Wild Sheep Chase, and Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. However, this novel is just as enjoyable, and just as worthwhile. This novel has a sustained emotional depth that other works by Murakami only achieve in passages.  If you're a fan of modern literature at all, do yourself a favor. Read Norwegian Wood, and read Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.  ken32\n"

aS"\nNo matter what one's political leanings are, a discerning reader will find both the factual and theoretical information presented in this book intriguing.  The author writes in a style I can best describe as clear and powerful:  he does not get bogged down in over-explanation of facts, and the unfolding events leading up to Secretary Brown's death read like a gripping suspense novel...except these events are well-documented NON-fiction.  The author's exhaustive research and hours of interviews with the people in Ron Brown's world are thoroughly documented.  As I read what had happened in the years prior to his death, I made my own connections and theories.  The author, Mr. Cashill, did not preach, and did not press theories and proposed scenarios as truth.  Mr. Cashill respects the reader...respects the reader's intelligence and deduction skills.  I must highly recommend this book:  you will not be bored, you will find it hard to put down, you will learn a lot, what you already know will be reinforced, and you will want to talk to others about it.\n"

I have had absolutely no trouble with mine, and would highly recommend this product to everyday users. \n \n I\'ve seen a couple of bad reviews simply because users purchased this computer with the intent to make it their "gaming" computer, and then were disappointed with the outcome.  Check the specs and your game requirements first.

aS"\nFirst, everything about the Kindle is quite true.  Its readability and convenience is outstanding.  I have read several books if the last few weeks because of its features.  I was an avid reader but increasing age has made printed books more of a challenge, but the Kindle with its varying font size and very light weight has made reading fun again.\n \n However I am currently on a road trip.  The Kindle was in a leather case and inside a padded pocket of my Apple laptop case.  On the third evening the Kindle was totally non responsive, just strange lines on the screen.  Amazon support says the symptoms indicate screen impact damage which is not covered by warranty. The case was not dropped nor was anything stacked on it.\n \n The dramatic video of the Kindle being dropped 30 inches is now somewhat suspicious.\n \n Amazon will replace for $200 and return of the failed unit, but I am now very concerned about its apparent fragility and Amazon's failure of responsibility for an expensive device.\n"

aS"\nI had heard about the fantasy books by a friend when they first came out but didn't have the time to look into them. By the time the movie came out, I'd nearly forgotten about the book referral, but asked my hubby to take me as it looked like a good vampire romance flick. The scenery of the Pacific Northwest forests, rivers, and coastline was breathtaking and as a native to this area, it was like going out into my own backyard which made the film that more appealing. I was so captivated by the actors portrayal of the characters (the facial expressions and emotions brought out of the characters by Rob, Kristen, Peter, Nikki, and the rest were mesmerizing) and the depth of the back-story left me desiring more! The very next day after viewing the movie in the theater - I raced to the bookstore to grab the first book. I was hooked, read through all four books (plus went to the authors website to read the extra materials she had posted there) in a week. Then, still not satisfied, went back and saw the movie several more times - IN THE THEATER, something I've never felt compelled to do before - because I was so drawn to the characters and the story. This may have been written for the young adult audience but I'm 32 and a parent of four children, and still found the story to be well worth my time. \n \n If you haven't read the stories, I encourage you to do so. Regardless, this film will be a treasured part of your movie collection and one you'll be sure to watch several times before you'll feel satisfied.\n"

aS"\nThis is a wonderful book. The author has a great sense of irony. He skillfully blends contemporary records and journals written by soldiers at  all levels of the hierarchy to show the incompetence of the &quot;arrogant  armies&quot; he's describing. This book goes very well with &quot;March of  Folly&quot; by Barbara Tuchman. It's unfortunate that amazon.com does not  list this book as a suggestion on this page. I just wish he would include  more examples from 1914-1989 years. I don't really understand why there's a  gap between the old European imperial period all the way up to Somalia.  There were plenty of wars that would qualify for this book in between.\n"

aS"\nHave been reading since age 4 (am now 68) and mostly fiction for the past 50 years.  A novel a week.  This trilogy is, in my opinion, the finest series I have ever read and Hornet's Nest may be the very best piece of fiction I have ever read.  I found myself purposely slowing down in my reading because I simply did not want it to end.  These are not stand alone books.  Read them as 1-2-3 and you will never forget the experience.  The biggest problem is what to read when you are finished.  Everything else pales by comparison by virtually every measure.  I envy those of you who have not started the journey or who are looking forward to the second and third novels. I almost look forward to the possibility of Alzheimers so I can read these over and over for the rest of my life. I may do so anyway.\n \n BR\n"

aS'\nLambert seems to be throwback to the "bigger than life" rock popularized by Bowie and Freddie Mercury and he pulls off this sound with sophistication and aplomb. Showing a very good range, Lambert hits both the rockers and ballads with a nice balance of hubris and control.  The first three cuts hit hard, with up tempo beats and a surprisingly plaintive vocal on "Whattaya Want From Me" gives the listener a good indication of what Lambert can do. "Strut" then takes things into more stylized mode and Lambert shows a bit of the over the top quality so necessary to pull off this style of song. Throughout the CD he surprises with a variety of styles and contributors like Rivers Cuomo and Pink keep things interesting. He still needs to find his own true voice, many things owe a bit too much to those who came before, ("Soaked" definitely seems to channel Mercury a bit too closely and a few others smack of pastiche rather than homage.) but overall this is an impressive debut.\n \n'

aS'\n*updated review at bottom*\n \n original review:\n So I bought this phone via sprint when it came out, should\'ve waited for amazon, would\'ve saved me about 75 dollars. ANYHOO! I love this phone!\n \n Pros:\n -All the apps, music capabilities, etc that the iphone has\n -Decent sound quality (I hear everyone crystal clear)\n -Touchscreen everything but you can use the optical mouse and slide out keyboard (which I love)\n -Extremely intuitive. I only had to refer to the manual once so far (had it about a week now) and that was to take the battery cover off (which I never ended up getting to in the book because I slid it off).\n -Decent battery life \n -regular headphones work with it\n \n Cons:\n - it\'s supposed to be 5.5 hours of talk time, but if you talk on it for 2 hours straight while playing games online (on the phone), it tends to be a bit shorter! So battery life took a star. Also regular usage gets it only 9 or 10 hours before you want to charge to be on the safe side.\n - If you put a pattern lock (have to draw a specific design/connect dots) on the phone to prevent it from doing things by accident via touch screen, it has a one-touch EMERGENCY DIAL button always present when you unlock the phone to use it. Which routes directly to your county 911. And if you realize it too late and hang up quickly the 911 operator calls you back to make sure you\'re ok. Which is a good idea but horrible if you\'re half asleep and grab the phone to check a text message.\n \n I\'ll update if I find anything new awesome and or horribly bad with it.\n \n But it\'s perfect for me. So I definately recommend.\n \n **update November 27, 2009**\n \n So I\'ve had this phone almost a month now and still in love with it. I did have a problem with the speaker phone not working (I could hear everyone crystal clear, but I was fading in and out even if I was not moving in a silent room with no background noise. Yes, I made someone help me test this before I officially concluded it WAS my phone afterall). I took it back to the Sprint Store I got it from (a few blocks from me) and they replaced it that day no charge at all (it has a 30 day unlimited warranty. This was about a week after I got the phone).\n \n I\'ve come to terms with the battery life issue after consulting with someone who has a g1 and has the same low battery problems. So it lasts me about 5-8 hours a day (usually tons of texting involved and applications being played) before it gives me the low battery (15% remaining) warning. Then I come home and stick it on the charger or just let it be until I know I can dedicate 3-4 hours to charging this baby up. (It did however last me from 1pm yesterday afternoon to 8am this morning with moderate texting and phone usage only before dying. Was able to make a phone call immediately once it was attached to the charger though).\n \n I still believe is the perfect phone for me of all out there on the market (and yes, I played with the Droid but hate the keyboard). It is sluggish to touch sometimes, double tapping the screen to "wake it up" during a phone call can inadvertantly lead to hanging up sometimes, and when you\'re typing very fast it doesn\'t always imput it right away or will get backed up on a few letters. I\'ve been using it as an mp3 player and hooking it to my car speakers while driving. It can charge AND play music at the same time. Some applications and games ARE more draining then others though, but you can generally figure out which ones.\n \n It\'s still, in my opionion, an all around wonderful phone.\n \n ***UPDATE *JULY 15, 2010* ***\n So still have the same actual phone as I did last time update, it\'s gone through 2 sprint updates needed to be done in store. So some changes to original review needed! The updates have fixed the issues of super short battery life (extremely high android/internet usage for a 16 hour period before needing a charge and otherwise normal usage (frequent but not high texting, somewhat high internet usage) will last the day (8am to 3am, so 29 hours roughly). Updates also fixed (apparently) the speakerphone issue and the mute button issue and the issue of hanging up accidently while trying to wake screen up during phone call. \n \n The android has been updated to 2.2 (or 2.1, double check on that. HAS BEEN UPDATED TO ONE OF THOSE THOUGH!). \n \n Touch screen occasionally will be taken over by ghosts (not really often, but enough to be mentioned), but I think that has more to do with the screen covers I put on there. \n \n The camera and video features now have zoom! Not a very BIG zoom, but a zoom nonetheless.\n \n Still love the phone, still recommend! :-)\n \n \n \n \n'

aS'\nThere is honestly no question that when it does come down to the best in quality printer, HP has really delivered the highest quality in ink cartridges, for their printers. That is proof with the number 60 cartridges. These are actually great and simple to install in my new deskjet printer. They deliver more ink that keeps them going well with each and every time I have to print up a project on paper. Whether it is writing up a resume, or printing coupons you need off the internet for all your shopping needs, they absolutely do the trick well. Anyone who owns a HP Printer knows what they get well in the quality of ink, and that is proof with the #60 cartridges.

aS"\nWhen I do not feel like carrying my heavy SLR camera and lenses, I take my Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 instead.  With the 14-45mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, the G1 is about one-third the weight of my Sony A900 SLR with a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens.  Of course, the G1's 12 megapixel sensor cannot compete with the A900's 24 megapixel sensor, and the 14-45 lens is neither as fast as, nor of equal quality to, the 24-70 lens, but the portability of the G1 means that I take it with me more often than I take my A900.  The Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 Digital Camera Case Gadget Bag  fits the G1 with 14-45 lens perfectly and attaches to my belt via a Velcro strap.  And the Canon WS20 Wrist Strap for all Canon Camcorders  is a convenient alternative if you don't want a camera strap around your neck.\n \n If I were to list all of the features of the G1 that I like, this review would be rather long, so here is a short list of my favorite features:\n \n 1. All of the buttons that control focus, metering, ISO, etc. are well positioned and easy to use.\n \n 2. A real time histogram may be displayed if desired.\n \n 3. In manual focus mode, the image is magnified in the high resolution electronic viewfinder so that precise focus may be achieved.\n \n 4. If desired, images may be stored in RAW (RW2) format in addition to the limiting JPEG format.  The RAW alternative allows for better noise suppression (see below).\n \n A consequence of the small 14-45 lens is that the lens is not particularly fast and so does not permit low light photography.  However, the Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras  remedies this problem.  Also available are the Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0 Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic Digital SLR Cameras  and Panasonic 45-200mm f/4.0-5.6 Lumix G Vario MEGA OIS Zoom Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic and Olympus Micro Four Thirds Cameras  lenses that extend the zoom range to 14-400mm (35mm equivalent).  And the camera plus all four lenses weigh a mere four pounds, so can easily be taken along on a hike.\n \n For those who would like to capture video, the Panasonic DMC-GH1 12MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 1080p HD Video , Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 12.1MP Micro Four-Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-45mm Lens  and the somewhat larger Nikon D5000 12.3 MP DX Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens and 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD  are attractive alternatives.  But I don't shoot video, so the G1 is a low priced solution to my need for a portable camera.\n \n The two weaknesses of the Panasonic G1 are:\n \n 1. The dynamic range of the sensor is a bit limited, with the consequence that it is fairly easy to blow out the highlights in an image.  I haven't found a good solution to this problem, other than to shoot in RAW mode and underexpose at bit when I want to capture cloud detail.\n \n 2. The sensor introduces a fair amount of noise above ISO 800.  However, this problem is nicely remedied if one shoots in RAW mode and uses Adobe Lightroom 3 to suppress noise.  This approach easily extends the useful ISO from 800 to 1600, and in some cases to 3200.\n \n Update: Panasonic has recently introduced the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G2 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-Inch Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Lumix G VARIO f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens (Black)  and Panasonic Lumix DMC-G10 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 14-42mm Lumix G Vario f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens  cameras.  Both of these cameras can record video.\n \n Also, it appears that the Sony Alpha NEX-3 and NEX-5 cameras, with their APS-C sensors, provide better image quality than any of the Panasonic cameras.  However, as of this writing, the Sony system does not provide as broad a zoom range as does the Panasonic system.\n \n"

Took me three days to read the book because it was so formulaic, so boring, so unreal, and just not funny.  Unbelievable story-line.  I don't like Vinnie.

While I don't believe that people are actually  being abducted by spacemen in flying saucers (a view the author seems to  share, incidently), I now believe this phenomenon is very real, and  probably very puzzling and frightening to the people who experience it.   For those people, this book should be an invaluable aid to help them take  control of their situation.  Recommended for anyone interested in the  subject.\n"

aS'\nIt seems the main reason Dr. Peter Lillback calls George Washington a Christian,and not a Deist is because he believed in Divine Providence,or the belief that God is active in peoples lives. When we think of Divine Providence we think of the word Theism, and all the Abrahamic faiths that claim God personally spoke to key individuals called Prophets in the form of personal revelations.\n \n Understandably as words do change (proving that the written word is not a good vehicle for the "word of God") from their original meaning, Mr.Lillback confuses the word Deist with the word Atheist (non-Theist) which really is the opposite of Theist.  \n \n In todays world the word Atheist for the most part implies that there is no God.  The word Atheist has changed from its original meaning,but we know that whenever you add an "a" in front of a word it means the opposite,so its the Atheist that believes in a inactive God,and not a Deist.\n \n The word Deist is derived from the word Deism that is derived from the word Deity which is simply the Latin word for God. A Deist is just someone who believes that God is,and the word Deism just implies a path of understanding. \n \n George Washington IMO was a Deist who was a Theist who followed the path called Deism.  He believed in God,he thought that God was active in his life,and he knew to look towards the Creation (the product that comes from God) to gain true insight.\n \n Since Mr. Lillback uses Thomas Paine for an example of a Deist we should at least take Thomas Paine\'s definition on who,or what a Deist is,and what a true Deist believe.  \n \n "Every person, of whatever religious denomination he may be, is a DEIST in the first article of his Creed. Deism, from the Latin word Deus, God, is the belief of a God, and this belief is the first article of every man\'s creed.\n \n It is on this article, universally consented to by all mankind, that the Deist builds his church, and here he rests. Whenever we step aside from this article, by mixing it with articles of human invention, we wander into a labyrinth of uncertainty and fable, and become exposed to every kind of imposition by pretenders to revelation"\n \n Thomas Paine thought that anyone who believes in God was a Deist (including all Christians) in the first article of his creed, which is the belief in a God. \n \n Mr. Lillback states in his book that Thomas Paine was a "hard Deist".  "Hard Deist", apparently a new title that Mr. Lillback says he made up to describe a Deist that doesn\'t believe in Divine Providence,or again the belief in the God that went away,and no longer intervenes in mans affairs. Again a "Hard Deist" if we must use the phrase describes what an Atheist would think,and not what a pure Deist would think.\n \n Dr. Peter Lillback either never read Thomas Paines works,or he\'s out right lying about Thomas Paines character in matters of God. All self professed Deists in our founding fathers day believed in Divine Providence even Thomas Paine. So "Hard Deist",or even Atheist would not apply to Mr. Paine because Thomas Paine was a Deist (he believed in God) who was a Theist (he believed that God was active in his life) who followed the path called Deism.\n \n In Mr. Lillbacks book he quotes Thomas Paine several times,but he takes his words out of context to make his point clear about who,or what a Deist is,and what a true,or pure Deist really believes about our Maker.\n \n Before I quote some key phrases from Thomas Paine that clearly prove that he, like George Washington believed in "Divine Providence" I ask the reader to examine \n \n "A Discourse At The Society Of Theophilanthropists"\n \n This was a Theistic church that Thomas Paine was a key founder. Proving that Mr. Paine believed in an active God right up till the end of his life.\n \n Thomas Paine called God "the Almighty lecturer".  God had something to say to Thomas Paine,and luckily for us he wrote most of it down in all his Theological writings.\n  \n "The Almighty Lecturer, by displaying the principles of science in the \n structure of the universe, has invited man to study and imitation. It is as if He said to the \n inhabitants of this globe, that we call ours, \'I have made an earth for man to dwell upon, \n and I have rendered the starry heavens visible, to teach him science and the arts. He \n can now provide for his own comfort, and learn from my munificence to all, to be kind to \n each other.\' " \n \n "The world has been amused with the term revealed religion, and the generality of priests apply this term to the books called the Old and New Testament. The Mahometans apply the same term to the Koran. There is no man that believes in revealed religion stronger than I do; but it is not the reveries of the Old and New Testament, nor the Koran, that I dignify with that sacred title. That which is revelation to me, exists in something which no human mind can invent, no human hand can counterfeit or alter.\n The Word of God is the Creation we behold; and this Word of God revealeth to man all that is necessary for man to know of his Creator."\n \n Mr. Lillback is using his own definition of what a Deist is to prove that George Washington wasn\'t a Deist,and his definition is wrong. Instead of making up your own definition of these words (Deist,or Deism) to prove your point why not get the correct definition from those who actually claim to be true,or pure Deists?  Most (not all) of todays self professed Deists of today like days of old will tell you that they believe in a active God. \n \n Did George Washington believe that our Creator overshadowed a young virgin girl who was engaged to be married to save us from the sins of the world,and all the mythologies that would also need to be believed as fact to prove this absurdity?  \n \n George Washington was enlightened enough to know mythologies from reality.  Lets not taint this great mans legacy by saying he believed the Bible as an absolute literal truth just because you do Mr. Lillback.\n \n This book IMO in no way proves George Washington was a true Christian.  Like they did with the man called Jesus years after his death making him into something he was not Dr. Peter Lillback does this with our great American hero George Washington. Turning,or perverting true \'history" into his story,and twisting reality in the process.  People who look for truth will know the difference.\n \n Mr.Lillback, we\'re all Deists who believe that God is.  Where we differ is our path of understanding. If you want to learn all about the faiths of our ancestors then the Bible,Koran,and the like are a great place to gain insight, however if you want to learn about God then you must look towards the Creation,or all the products that come from God. I think George Washington knew this truth as he was surrounded by other enlightened "pure" Deists.\n \n Mr. Washington knew that books prove that man is real,and the Creation proves that God is real. \n \n This book will look great next to the other fat book in the evangelical library.  Remember just because a book is thick,and fat doesn\'t make it fact.\n'

aS"\nWe have had this in our house for a week, and I must say that there are many features in this that improve over the earlier LEGO games by this company.  My son (11) and daughter (15), whom I have watched with his friends rather than played myself (on a new flatscreen TV, which admittedly adds to their excitement), are utterly mesmerized by the world and narrative that they are able to enter with this game.\n \n When I bought it (in Europe at about 1/3 more in price), I was worried that it would only be a simple variation on the earlier LEGO video games.  To summarize, the earlier games (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Batman, all of which we have in more than one format) allow children to become part of the story.  They know the films, but are able to interact in the environment and create their own versions.  These are not games with an adversary to beat or at least compete against, but a collaborative journey where you try to get through a number of obstacles, more similar to a maze than, say, monopoly.  This is a wonderful variation for kids, who too often seek enemies in video games or someone to conquer.  In the LEGO tradition, there is also a building motif, where you collect enough parts to get to a kind of construction critical mass, so you win a level and objects are assembled and a film episode is played with LEGO characters.  It has action, but is not bloodily violent, so good for little kids.  Finally, it is easy to start over and keep going on a journey through the films.  Just this makes these unique game concepts, but you can only get so many.  There is absolutely wonderful detail and characters in a simplified LEGO version that is charming, though they don't talk.\n \n While this is definitely in continuity with the earlier games and so reassuringly familiar as all great brands should be, I was happily impressed with this version, which I think is a quantum improvement.  The environment is more complex and multi-facetted, with all of the HPotter universe to explore.  The levels and tasks they have to perform are more complex than the earlier games, so it is longer lasting, and there appears to me to be more character in the powers and personalities of each figure that my kids can choose to play.  There is absolutely nothing that seems derivative about this.  For example, instead of hitting, whipping, or cutting with a light saber, they can cast spells that are far more varied in their effects.  As a school, there are also lessons to learn at each stage, which adds a new dimension that relates to the narrative.\n \n Warmly recommended.  This is a wonderful addition to an evolving medium.\n \n \n \n \n"

aS"\nThis was recommended to us as the next best thing to breast feeding, when those weren't available for one reason or another.  In our case, this was used primarily when daughter and daddy (me) were together without mommy.  \n \n Objectively, it's got the good stuff per the label:  Organic, DHA, and iron fortified.  Given what you hear about harmful agents in food, it gave my wife and I peace of mind knowing that this is organic.  \n \n Subjectively, our daughter loved it and didn't give any pause when gulping it down.  In fact, she seemed to dig it, usually sucking the bottle dry in short order.  I've heard that some babies can be finicky when it comes to formula, but we had no such experience with this product.  Indeed, we tried others that didn't seem as satisfying.  My much more mature taste buds also gave this a thumb's up, finding it tasty and smooth, though admittedly I had only cow's milk to compare.  On the practical side, this mixed up quickly and completely with water; it was smooth and creamy, with no un-disolved clumps or grittiness.  I used to pre-measure some in bottles when we went out so I could just add water and shake it up and that worked great.  \n \n The best testimonial I can give, other than saying that it pleased our daughter's discerning palate, is that this is the only formula I will use for our next child.\n"

It was consistent first with my resting pulse rate.  And at the gym the Star Trec Treadmill picked up the signal and registered the same as it did yesterday when I didn't have the Timex unit.  \n \n I'm 70 years old.  It was really great to NOT have to grab the treadmill sensors with both hands to check my pulse while jogging 6+MPH.   The new Star Trec treadmill picked up the Timex signal and displayed my heart rate so I didn't even have to look at the watch.  Of course it comes in handy on the rowing machine and the torso machine, acting as an incentive to push to my maximum heart rate.  \n \n It may be that the watch battery (or more likely the sensor battery) will run down after a couple of months of daily use.  I don't actually know how long the batteries will last or how resilient the unit is to abuse.  \n I hope it will outlast the cheap but comfortable plastic watch band.  Now that I have used it once I don't want to jog, bicycle, or go the gym without it.\n"

aS'\nTo echo what others have said this book is hilarious.  It\'s also sweet and touching.  Justin\'s dad is a gruff Vietnam vet, retired research doctor who is honest to a fault.  He\'s someone who knows himself and has the courage and a burning need to speak his mind.  He also loves his family to distraction.  Justin\'s dad is Jewish and his mom a quiet, loving Catholic and though their child rearing approaches seem as different as their religions they make a good parenting team.  \n \n Here are a few quotes which are NOT the funniest in the book but one\'s that are relatively lacking in four letter words:\n \n On Getting an Internship at Quentin Tarantino\'s Production Company:\n \n "That is one ugly son of a `gun\'.....Oh, yeah, no congratulations.  If you see him, try not to stare at his face if you\'ve eaten anything."\n \n After Justin moves out"\n \n "You just barge in and take whatever you want, whenever you want it.  It\'s like you\'re the ********* SS I\'m living in ******* Nazi Germany...."\n \n At the End of the Day, at Least You a Have a Family:\n \n "So, there you go.  Your mother thinks you\'re handsome.  This should be an exciting day for you."\n \n On a hypothesized life of crime:\n \n "You always got us.  We\'re family.  We ain\'t going anywhere.  Unless you go on a ******* killing spree or something."\n \n "I would still love you Justy.  I would just want to know why you did it," my mom said earnestly.\n \n All these quotes can seem a bit over the top when you read them out of context but they never come across as glib or hate filled.....just honest.  Justin was the youngest of three sons and the last chapter of the book is the story of one of Justin\'s love affairs gone awry and his dad comforting by telling the story of his first wife\'s life and death.  The best thing about this book, besides the humor of course, is the emotional honestly.\n \n'

I opened up and removed the small plastic cover on the bottom of my computer, released the clips holding the original supplied 1 GB memory card in place (when you release the clips, the card pops up for easy removal), replaced the original card with this one, replaced the cover, inserted the battery, and turned on the computer.\n \n This new memory card was instantly recognized.\n \n I did NOT have to press the F2 or F10 key. I do not know why some others had to do this (and I do not doubt their experiences) but, immediately after I installed the card and turned on the computer in the normal fashion, I checked the memory available - and there was my 2 GB of RAM showing.\n \n The entire mechanical installation process is quite simple and straightforward. The only tool necessary is a small Phillips-head screwdriver (mine came in a screwdriver set from Dollar Tree!) to remove the screws. Please note that, for the Asus Eee PC 1000 line, there are several YouTube videos which show in detail the whole process which takes no more than two or three minutes. The hardest part? Carefully removing the plastic cover on the back of the computer. The screws remove easily but there are several internal plastic clips on the sides of the cover (not visible) which must be released gently so as not to break them (they do seem robust, however).\n \n Once the cover is removed, actually removing and replacing the memory is simple.\n \n I have used Crucial memory cards in other laptop computers over the years and I have always found them to be completely reliable.\n \n Therefore I highly recommend this memory card, especially for Asus Eee PC 1000 owners.\n'

aS"\nI just got my new Garmin 765T last night -- I live in a rural area of Oregon.  It immediately recognized the road I live on, so I was pleasantly surprised.  We drove 90 miles north to Eugene today and it only missed a fwy on-ramp that had been redesigned a couple of years back.  I haven't updated this yet, so in my mind, weather or not an update resolves this, I have NO complaints.  It gives plenty of warning when to turn.  The volume is perfect in my van -- I had to lower it actually, so not to be annoying.  The Bluetooth worked perfectly -- it is compatible with my T-Mobile Prepaid phone.  I used it to call home and I could hear very well via the Garmin speakers and was also heard by the person I was calling.  (The person who commented about not being able to listen to the Garmin thru the car radio FM speakers using a favorite station instead of a static source is a worthless feature... That's the way any FM transmitter device of this type works).  I am very glad I purchased this item.  Granted, I haven't used the MP3 player or the Audio Book features.  I will update at a later time once I've had more time with this GPS.  In the meantime, it did a great job today and I am very satisfied with everything about this item.\n"

The mesh pockets on the side are also a great feature.\n'

aS'\nif you like it or dont, its all good lighthearted fun. dont get too serious with it or it will turn out to be more than what you may want to be in. the product itself is great, the board is pretty good. however i do miss the felt sliders, this one has plastic feet. assembly is minimal and doesnt take an expert. i havent used it in the dark so i cant say anything about the glowing aspect. im sure like most glow in the dark things you get a few minutes and thats it. overall a good cheap ouija board to play with\n'

aS"\nWhat a great stroller and seat. This stroller is high quality, so yes, there's a high price tag! But it's worth it. People are constantly complimenting my new stroller. It's a cutting edge stroller and the price tag shows it. I have a 2 month old and a 17m old... it's perfect for us! Thanks Baby Jogger for yet another great product!\n \n Update: 2.5 months later- still LOVING my stroller! I have both seats, and the car seat adapter. Love, love, love it. It's the most expensive baby product we own and it should be- I use it the most. I wanted a stroller that would allow me to bust out of the house with two babies or just one baby if needed... this did it. I don't need two strollers anymore! By the way, our boys are huge and this stroller holds them well. Our 18 month old is 30 pounds and the 3 month old is 16 pounds... still trucks along like nothing!\n"

aS"\nHellhound on his Trail is an outstanding book.  Sides writes about all that happened before and after  the assasination of ML King In Memphis in 1968.  His writing style is captivating at a minimum.  Even though we know how it turns out, I couldn't put the book down.  The reader learns what is going on inside the King organization prior to the killing and what is going on with the assassin, James Earl Ray.  The author is from Memphis and his love and concern for the city shows in the way he invovles Memphis in the unfolding drama.  The tension around the actual shooting, and the unbelievably thorough search for Ray were the best parts of the book for me.  By the time the good guys have Ray under arrest, I felt like I had grown to actually know him.  I would have liked to see the author wrtie a bit more about the trial and Ray's time in prison, but I guess the book had to have boundaries.  A great, and fun read.  Unqualified five star recommendation\n"

aS"\nThis book was highly recommended by a fellow Amazon reviewer whose tastes mirror my own. Not only did she give it an excellent review, when we spoke she sang its praises. So, I went and bought the book. After all, I had read books by Anne Rice, as well as Donna Boyd, and enjoyed them. So, obviously books about vampires and/or lycanthropes are hardly a stretch for me.\n \n To my surprise, I was hooked once I began turning the pages of this book. It is a totally fun book to read, with its diminutive, feisty heroin, Anita Blake, a formidable vampire hunter who now focuses on being an animator, one who raises the dead. She lives in an alternate America where vampirism is legal, and vampires of the world are flocking to our shores. In good old St. Louis, Missouri, where  our intrepid heroine lives, vampires live openly among humans and have developed a bizarre cult following. Of course, since killing vampires is against the law, Anita works closely with the police supernatural squad.\n \n Someone, however, is killing vampires, and although the police is investigating, the most powerful vampire in the city, Nicholaos, a thousand year old being who is ensconced in the body of a beautiful  pubescent girl, has commissioned her to find the killer.  The reluctant Anita, who finds herself at odds with evil Nicholaos, finds an unexpected ally and friend in the handsome Jean-Claude, a two centuries old vampire for whom she feels an unexpected attraction and affinity. \n \n Anita finds herself in a number of hair-raising situations as she seeks to discover the killer. Along the way she is plagued by vampires,  wererats, ghouls, other animators, and fellow humans. The plot is fast-paced and intriguing. Its characters capture the reader's imagination. While most of them are not particularly well-fleshed, as it  is basically a plot driven book, the main character, Anita Blake, is quite interesting, as well as compelling, and resonates with the reader. \n \n The author manages to pull together a highly entertaining and enjoyable book. The style is part detective potboiler, part mystery, and part fantasy with supernatural portents. It carries the reader along from its first page to its last, never losing its momentum. In fact, it leaves the reader wanting more. Good thing that this is merely the first in a series of books about this intrepid vampire hunter, Anita Blake. I look forward to reading them all. \n \n \n \n"

aS"\nAs previously noted these movies are all great movies and the sound and picture quality on the dvd's themselves are outstanding. Great work! I would have given it five stars but the lack of extra's for the price I payed is out there. Where are the deleted scenes that were repeatedly mentioned? If Lucas and Speilberg refuse to do commentary then why aren't there cast commentaries? No outtakes reel! Granted the 2 hour documentary is very nice and I love seeing the trailers its just a set like this should have been loaded. Lets take for example the Back to the Future dvd's, yes there was that whole widescreen issue but the extra's on those dvd's had everything, 2 commentaries for each disk, documentaries, and deleted scenes, plus the price was resonable!  Like I said most of us will be happy with these dvd's for the most part, and for the proper 2:35 widescreen transfers but I felt Lucas could have included a lot more extra's than were included on this set. Marketing I suppose in a few years it will be rereleased again with all new features, but at the moment I think Indiana Jones is almost up there with Star Wars for the record amount of rereleases.\n"

aS"\nI had owned various phones in the past and Nokia is the best on any comparison, for the Features available on this phone, had Apple had all these features it will cost 10 times more, most people don't even know it has extra camera on the front for video Calls along  with the 3.2 MP on the back, Video is far better and there were no sluggish performance as far as I had used for more than a month, unlike iPhone this phone can run multiple applications at same time which is like multitasking in PC, so I can play music and browse websites at same time and switch to GPS , attend a call and type an SMS.. And it goes on...all at same time, iPhone cannot do more than one at a time, we get millions of free software, games, themes etc., unlike Apple App store, no need to pay more and more. Best feature, no MP3 conversion required, if you have lot of MP3 files on hard disk just drag and drop in few seconds, we can play, phone comes with 8GB of SD Card, can upgrade to 16 GB, that's more than enough, I had used the N95 earlier which costs double this price, this is not a NSeries phone from nokia, but it had all the features + touch screen of N series phone at half the price.\n \n If you like Garmin for GPS, Garmin GPS software available for this phone and installing that will make it the best GPS (it comes with Nokia's map software too) and no data plan or internet required for GPS as maps are copied to memory. It comes with lot of add on and Its not too big like iPhone and not too small, exactly made for using with single hand and I had replaced the blackberry phone used for Office with this and configured my Office outlook exchange server along with Gmail, hotmail and yahoo, how cool is that.\n \n It handles website just as a PC and there is no difference with any websites, I can login to bank accounts and do anything like PC, it has stereo speakers but the Nokia Headsets are far Superior in sound quality and build and it comes with built in Mic and buttons for music track change so we can play music and attend calls without touching phone.\n \n And FM is there to use while driving and at the Gym, Google has lot of software available for this phone like latitude, docs etc. If you want free chat software Fring (www.fring.com) is available for free, it connects yahoo, hotmail, AOL, Gtalk and Skype users all in one place and we can even make voice calls to online users. It has the great sync software that syncs all your photos, videos, contacts, notes etc between phone and PC using Bluetooth, just switch on the PC and it does the sync automatically. We can import and export all contacts from outlook, Lotus notes etc.\n \n And there is software to use the screen as a touch screen mouse for the PC like a wireless Bluetooth mouse and that's free too.\n \n For brand conscious users like me, I want to buy a phone from a telecom company like Nokia than a computer (apple) or TV (Samsung) company, who were just trying phones as one of their business.\n \n iPhone doesn't have many of these features and only selling because of marketing, if nokia did their part, this should beat any phone for sure, I don't want to lock with AT&T for lifetime with iPhone and pay $ monthly and pay for any applications and did I say its unlocked? What else you can expect from a phone?\n"

aS'\n\'Commando Craps & Blackjack!\' by John Gollehon is a good book in that some of the basic "rules" (or disciplines as Gollehon calls them) of gambling (bide your time, start small and work your way up, avoid greed, set a predetermined \'loss\' limit, small wins are still wins, etc...) are sound advice for any gambler.  However, in explaining the rules of craps, this book falls short in my opinion.  The advise seems pretty elementary  (play the passline, play the odds, play the come line, etc...), but doesn\'t explain everything an inexperienced player needs to know about the game.  Gollehon glosses over the prop bets (mentioning only the Hardways and then actually contradicts himself.) No mention of horn bets, C&Es, any sevens.\n \n For blackjack, the advise is really standard advise.  Just type \'blackjack strategy chart\' on Google and print yourself out a chart.  There.  You\'re done.  You have the \'optimum\' strategy for blackjack (and you can take it into the casino with you).\n \n I would say that one should read the 1st half for the disciplines and basic gambling philosophies and then read a more detailed book for a greater understanding of the rules of blackjack and craps.\n'

The portions are perfect as well when mixing the two. \n \n It was very tasty and quite filling too. This is probably my current favorite KOI meal. I've tried the rajma masala, dal bukara, pindi chana, and palak paneer. My second favorite would have to be the pindi chana. The rajma is OK but I don't prefer the flavor as much. The palak paneer is a little bland but oddly spicy. And the dal bukara is quite salty.\n"

aS'\nWe have two Roombas plus a Scooba in our house. When one of the batteries on one of our Roombas finally reached the end of its life cycle, we decided to donate that Roomba to a friend and to get ourselves the new top of the line - the Roomba 560. We got this right when it first came out, but we waited several months before posting a review. It\'s pretty much impossible to review one of these Roombas after only a few days! It takes weeks if not months to start to see how well they last over time, and what breaks down. Believe me - been there, done that.\n \n So now it\'s many months later, and I have to say, we are quite pleased with the improvements of this Roomba over the previous generations of Roombas. So first, for those who don\'t even have ANY Roomba yet (hard to believe!). Roombas are awesome. We have cats, and we work from home so we\'re home all day. It is AMAZING how much dirt and dust and junk collects in the carpet every single day. Who really has time to vacuum their carpets twice a day any more? With the Roomba, you set the scheduler to do it while you are asleep. You wake up in the morning, the carpets are clean, the air is fresh, and you empty out the dust bin. It is just wonderful.\n \n Even those without pets might be amazed how much lint and such the Roomba will find every morning for you.\n \n I have a noise meter and have done several tests with the noise meter. The Roomba is much quieter than other regular vacuums. It is NOT silent - it can\'t be! How could it vacuum up dirt and be silent? But it is quieter than the alternatives, and heck, you\'re sleeping anyway. I can easily sleep through a Roomba running.\n \n Now, on to the improvements of this new Roomba over previous models. First, it has a cool feature where the speed drops when it senses it is approaching a solid object. The old Roomba would just run full tilt into an object - wall, couch etc. - and then turn around. This one slows down so that it hits the object gently. Sure the old Roomba wouldn\'t dent the walls with its powerful force, but still, it\'s nice to have it be gentle on furniture and your building.\n \n Next, for better or for worse, the new Roomba is much more aware of when its bin and brushes are getting grungy. I admit I didn\'t clean my other Roombas as often as I should have. And it led to problems. This new Roomba will actually stop and warn you when it\'s getting full and when the brushes should be cleaned. If you\'re a procrastinator like I am, this is a good thing. If you\'re a clean freak that empties the bin every time, and cleans the brushes every time, then you probably won\'t even notice this feature.\n \n The anti tangle technology is nice. The previous Roomba would start to eat a cord and just keep going until it was really stuck. This Roomba at least tries to get itself untangled. Still, I don\'t recommend leaving cords and strings and things lying around. You\'re just asking for trouble if you do.\n \n The new system uses a "lighthouse" instead of just a wall. With a lighthouse, you mark out a room so the Roomba finishes with that room completely before going on to the next room. They are like section markers. We tend to just use walls, but if you have two large rooms the lighthouse feature might be really helpful for you.\n \n After several months of running we have had NO problems at all with our Roomba. No broken brushes, no falling off pieces, nothing. It is still going strong and we are very pleased with it.\n \n Highly, highly recommended! I am happy to give personal advice and I even have videos of Roombas on my website. I love Roombas, they have saved me countless hours of work, and they make my home a much cleaner and easier-breathing place to be.\n'

aS"\nI purchased the BD590 from Best Buy a couple of days after it first appeared in stock.       I have had some experience with LG Bluray before since I own the also excellent BD390 so when I needed another one for a different room in the house the newer model LG was at the top of my list.\n \n Having owned it for a few weeks I have the following to note.\n \n Pros\n \n 1.   Fast Blu-Ray loading times.   Very crisp clear image and fortunately since I own a receiver capable of decoding Lossless HD formats I really like the sound as well.   Does the Blu ray format justice\n 2,   My favorite aspect of this and the BD 390 by far is the VUDU functionality.  I think Vudu is a tremendous service (perhaps will get even better now that's its been purchased by Wal-Mart).   To have a large library of 1080p HD available at your fingertips is fantastic and the LG does a nice job displaying very pleasing audio and video off Vudu.  I would buy this for this feature alone.\n 3,  Although no shortage of Netflix ready devices in my HT lineup having this and other internet sources such as Pandora are nice options.\n 4.  I read some complaints about the new interface compared to the older LGs but to my eyes its nicer looking and just as easy to navigate\n 5.  I used Ethernet to connect this player but did test out the 802.11n and was able to connect to my Airport Extreme powered network with no problems\n 6.  CD ripping is a great feature and I was able to archive a library of 200 CDs or so with little trouble.   Gracenote does a nice job tagging the tracks.\n \n \n Cons\n I really didn't find much not to like about this player.    Mostly just nice to haves.  I would have liked if it supported Amazon VOD since that's my other source for video and I did think that the footprint was still a little large although sleeker and lighter that my older model.\n \n I first lucked into the BD390 when it was highly recommended by a HT installer.  I am pleased to note that the 590 is a nice upgrade with newer functionality on an old favorite.   Highly recommended.\n"

aS'\nThis little TV is great for a kitchen or as a small tv for a guest room or childs room. The remote is simple and concise. Setup is a breeze. Wall mounts easily. The picture is excellent. The viewing angle is excellent. I researched alot of 19" LCD TV\'s and decided on this one. Many other 19" tv\'s have a poor viewing angle...this one does not. The picture is clear. You will not go wrong with this TV. I have mine connected to a small radio shack Hi-DEF off-air antenna for the kitchen. I was amazed that I gets over 20 HD channels on it. The antenna is small and mounted outside. I would really compare this TV to Sony, Samsung. Its just as good. Not to mention the price..wow..it was about the same price as the bargain, off-brand TV"s.

aS'\nThis was an interesting read.  Why spend all sorts of money on yarn when I already have two fuzz producing critters?  But then again who wants to wear a hat that smells like dog?  \n \n Smell was my biggest worry when I ran across this book. I know only too well how stinky my wet dogs can be, but apparently they say the smell can be washed out quite permanently and easily and then they ask if one has ever smelled a sheep up close.  Good point!\n \n With smell issues out of the way, I read on with interest.  Instead of throwing away all of that lovely golden fur floating around my home, I might actually be able to use it.  Of course this involves quite a bit of work.  Daily brushings, the labor intensive washing, washing and washing again of the fuzz (without clogging your drain in the process), then one must card (comb)the fuzz so it all lays the way it should, then you\'ve got to oil it, spin it (an art in itself) and ply it into yarn.  Yikes, it looks so easy when laid out in a few pages in a book but it sounds too much like work for someone like me.  \n \n After you\'ve done all of the above, if you\'re one of those inexhaustible types, you can knit hats, scarves and just about anything that you\'d knit with wool.  The projects seem pretty straightforward but the instructions assume one has some familiarity with knitting.  There are scarves, hats, mittens sweaters, even a doggie sweater (the pic shows a pug smugly wearing a  sweater made from newfoundland fur, way too cute!).  You must know the basic stitches, know all about knitting the round, know how to use your double pointed and circular needles and how to work fair isle/intarsia if you want to finish many of these items.  I would\'ve appreciated a little knitting 101 section here (especially for the color work, are you supposed to purl or knit the colors??), but that\'s just me and I suppose that stuff can easily be found on google but still . . .\n \n The other downside of this book are the black and white photos.  The items are described as beautiful tones of "golden retriever fur" or whatever and then they show a grainy b&w photo of a fuzzy looking scarf which was so disappointing.  There also are not nearly enough photos showing how to make and use the drop spindle (though the carding section was well illustrated and appears simple enough).  I seriously doubt I could learn the art of spinning dog fuzz using only this book and will look for a video if I ever get my fuzzies washed and ready (I think this part intimidates me the most!).\n \n There is a section outlining breeds and their "spinability" for those on the lookout for fuzz machines.  Lucky for me, my two goldens are top producers but my lab is a poor choice.  Apparently, though, his "short chocolate sprinkles" can be added to all of the glamorously soft golden fur to spice up the color.  Who knew?\n \n This was an informative, very niche book, that takes its topic seriously and was a fun read.  It\'s got me looking at the fuzz balls in a new way but I\'m not sure if I\'ll ever work up the energy to collect, wash, card, and then spin this stuff into workable yarn because I\'m just too lazy.  Though it might make a nice little side business for someone with a lot of time to spare.  Imagine a keepsake of your beloved pet like no other.  The possibilities are endless . . .\n \n'

aS"\nI've had this attached to my key ring for a number of years.  I don't need it often but when I have it's been useful as long as I am very careful while handling it.  The knife is extremely sharp and because the key is pretty thin it can rotate easily in your fingers. It's not incredibly easy to close around a key ring with one hand, and does with a bit of a snap, so you need to make sure your fingers are well out of the way when you do.  The Phillips screwdriver on the end of one of the tines is helpful for things like tightening eyeglasses, but it is slightly offset from the opposing blade and I've nicked or jabbed myself with it more than once while it's in my pocket.  You're supposed to lock it at either 90 or 180 degrees when using it, but when you close it from 90 the keyring end easily grabs at your fingers.  This isn't a product for kids, and only should be used with extreme care.\n"

aS'\nWhen Michael Jackson died on June 25th 2009 it seems a part of the world died with him. It made many people sad all over the world and it seems that for once everyone was being nice to this man who had always been abused by the Medias; journalists, interviewers and others. When I heard of the "This Is It" movie concert I didn\'t know what to think. I knew it was rehearsal footage from the 50 concerts he was to perform at the O2 arena but I didn\'t know what was going to come out of it or what they were going to do with it. When I saw the trailers I knew I had to see this and that "This Is It" was going to be something special like I\'ve never seen. And that\'s precisely what I got, I even bought my ticket in advance for the movie and feel like it was much worth it.\n \n It amazed me how good MJ still was, the dance moves were great and fascinating to me. He was clearly the one in charge of the whole thing. He gave precise instructions of what he wanted, made sure everything was right and did everything that needed to be done. The film shows just how much Michael was respected, there were parts of it where they asked him if he wanted anything or what he thought and if he liked something, it seems no one assumed anything at all. When he talked the crew would listen and he asked things in the nicest way, never to hurt anyone. There\'s not a part that doesn\'t make him look like the nice guy he always was. There are mixed feelings about him after all the bad things that have been said about him but after watching this I don\'t know one could possibly believe them.\n \n To be honest I loved every minute of it, every song was special and was great to watch. Right from the beginning of "Wanna Be Startin\'Somethin\'" it was amazing. No matter how many people surround him he\'s always the one who does things better than anyone else and the one you\'re watching. This Is It was really a unique experience, I felt they chose the right footage parts for the movie and made him look great in every sense. They could truly have messed things up but they didn\'t and came out with an amazing documentary, it\'s sort of a testament to his fans, it\'s just very special. I really liked the Thriller 3D part, it was a 3D video shoot and afterwards you see MJ coming out onstage from a spider, the show would have looked awesome. They Don\'t Care About Us was amazing, The Smooth Criminal part was very interesting, so was the Earth Song which had a beautiful video of a little girl in a forest, waking up to see that all of it has been destroyed. I won\'t go further but every song had something about them. \n \n The stage show would have been grandiose, the fireworks, the "fireball" (quite impressive I won\'t spoil anything), pyrotechnics, the videos that accompany the songs are all very impressive. This could very well have been the best show ever had he lived to perform them. In the end I was quite amazed by the 1: 48 minutes I watched, I can\'t wait to see it again and the message Michael gives at the end is very inspiring. From the auditions of the brilliant performers to the credits with the "This Is It" song I was captivated.\n \n The said special features will feature more of the rehearsal and a two part documentary on Michael\'s history and his comeback along behind the scenes. I can\'t wait to see more of the rehearsal and hopefully the extras will be great and there will plenty to watch.\n \n It\'s hard for me to describe what watching this movie was like and what I felt about it. I know this is rehearsal footage but it\'s truly brilliant and while it main not catch Michael at his best it certainly catches him at his most honest. I don\'t have anything bad to say about either this movie or the man himself, This Is It is a must see. It doesn\'t matter if you watch in its theatrical run or on DVD/Blue Ray when released, this is amazing and his fans just have to see this. I will certainly be amongst those who buy it and watch it over and over again. This man gave his life to music and his fans and I don\'t remember where I heard or read this but I do remember that someone said: "He was a gift of god, he was a kind human being who\'s been mistreated by many opportunists, he\'s been taken advantage of but he was the nicest person and could never harm anyone" or sometime like that. These words are very truthful and really mean something to his fans.  \n \n'

I had previously ordered the Sony MDR-NC60 headphones and sent them back within 10 minutes due to a very annoying humming/vibration in the right ear cup.

My partner has the Bose QC3 headphones and I have to say these sound just as good if not better and they are less than half the price; the QC3 sound a little "muddy" on the lows.\n \n The other great feature is the AAA battery used to power them and the hard case that comes for storage (great for packing in luggage).  No need to worry about having a plug on the airplane when your battery dies (just be sure to pack an extra AAA). \n \n If you are in the market for noise cancelling headphones, do yourself a favor and give these a listen.

aS'\nThese pills will definitely help you lose weight, though I think a large component of the weight lost is merely water. Like other reviewers have stated, this product will dehydrate you like nothing else. It does a great job at suppressing your appetite, so when you do eat, you\'re more likely to "remember" to eat something healthy - as opposed to raiding the fridge when you\'re ravenous. \n \n These pills have helped me lose weight (I\'m not talking a ton of weight, but enough to keep me re-purchasing the product). My only complaint is this: this seller - and many sellers of this product - claim the following: "PACKAGES WITH SILVER ON BOTH SIDES ARE FAKE! The authentic capsules are are packaged with green foil on one side and silver on the other. Beware of sellers that lie to you about all silver packaging. The fake all silver packaging is not effective, so don\'t waste your money." See above item description. \n \n Uh, anyway -- the item I received had silver on BOTH sides. Does that mean the seller sold me a fake product? If so, why would he/she broadcast that? Who knows. I ordered these pills before from a different seller and the packaging has ALWAYS been silver on both sides. Perhaps this seller can  either 1) remove that verbiage that says the product I purchased from his/her company is FAKE, or 2) clarify whether the packaging has changed since the above claim.\n'

aS'\nEven conservatives will like this book. It\'s interesting, inspiring, clearly written, not at all political and, believe it or not, only a tad self-centered. Filled with dozens, maybe hundreds, of specific examples of charitable individuals and successful grassroots programs, it argues -- in fact, proves -- that you don\'t have to be a big shot to make the world a better place. Clinton clearly believes in what he writes; the book is passionate and powerful on topics that, in other hands, would be detached and dull. \n \n Besides the subject matter, what I liked best about the book is its organization. Written so you don\'t have to read it all at once, it breaks down philanthropy into six different categories, and gives each its own chapter. Those are:\n \n * Giving time\n * Giving things\n * Giving skills \n * Giving "gifts of reconciliation and new beginnings" (citing everything from the efforts of Nelson Mandela to PeacePlayers International, a group that sets up basketball leagues in the Middle East)\n * Giving gifts that keep on giving (such as the work of Heifer International, which gives millions of poor farmers free cows -- as long as they agree to donate one its first offspring to someone else)\n * Giving to good ideas\n \n Clinton also includes descriptions of some successful charitable programs that are easy to use as model strategies for your own ideas, illustrates how businesses can make money out of acting in the public interest, and explains his views on what roles governments (not just Washington, but cities and states) can play. \n \n In the last chapter, titled "How Much Should You Give and Why," he argues that if the rich would donate five percent of their incomes to humanitarian causes, the rest of society would give even more, and that one reason to be generous and public spirited is simply that it makes you feel good. "Who\'s happier?" he writes. "The uniters or the dividers? The builders or the breakers? The givers or the takers? I think you know the answer."\n \n Regardless of your political views, if you\'re a charitable person and seriously want to make a difference in the world, this is a must-read. You\'ll come away from it not only inspired, but with plenty of ideas on how to accomplish your goals.\n'

A note of caution: the instructions were amateurish - I would have appreciated more details since this was my first time installing a chandelier.  But a quick search online and I was able to find better instructions.  It ended up taking a couple of hours to assemble and install but it was well worth the time.  It looks fantastic in my dining room and the price is hard to beat.\n'

aS'\nThis is a great "lite" power tool to have around the house. For handling screws, drilling drywall, etc, it\'s excellent. The battery life is really good and the multitude of torque settings are useful. However, if you\'re wanting to do some serious home improvement projects, you should look elsewhere. I\'ve found it to be a bit anemic when dealing with anything other than soft wood or drywall. If you need to drill metal, concrete, or tile this definitely will not get the job done adequately. I\'m happy with it for what it is, which is a great tool for small jobs at a great price.\n'

aS'\nI picked up the DVDs for the first two "Anne of Green Gables" series after seeing the musical version of the story in Charlottetown. I lucked out because the DVDs have been out less than a month. The actual film, of course, is worth 5 stars all by itself and is a classic adaptation of a beloved novel, so what I want to talk about is why Anne\'s fans should pick up the DVD version as well. There are cast bios, previews of the other "Anne" works by Sullivan films, and some production stills. \n \n However, the chief charms of the DVD version are the following: First, there is Megan Follows\' audition for the part of Anne, which is fascinating to see her first attempts at nailing the character of Anne Shirley. You will notice considerably changes in her actual performance, but the raw talent is amply displayed. Second, there are missing scenes, most of which have to do with the wife of Reverend Allen. It seems the production was co-produced by a German company and so there was this extended subplot with Mrs. Allen, played by a German actress, that was fully integrated into the Germany version of "Anne of Green Gables." Third, there is Directors Commentary from Kevin Sullivan and the film\'s editor, although the latter is there mainly to given the director someone to talk to during the almost four hour film. The commentary is certainly fascinating, as we find out where certain scenes were short (mostly around Toronto, but some on Prince Edward Island), when scenes were shot (Megan would have to play Anne at 16 in the morning and 12 in the afternoon), as well as great stories about Colleen Dewhurst leaving a scene about to explode in laughter or adding a line. \n \n However, for all these fascinating tidbits about the production you will find yourself surprised from time to time that Kevin Sullivan often does not have a clue about the story of Anne and why it works. He expresses surprise, for example, that audiences find the scene where Anne thanks Matthew for the dress with puffed sleeves to be so emotional. Sheesh. She is looking at him with absolute love and devotion in her eyes and he says, "Don\'t you like it." Of course it gets to you. But not Sullivan apparently. Still, the commentary is first rate and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it and using it to track down sites I intend to visit later this week in Toronto (I am going to find THE BRIDGE!). Finally, there are some behinds the scenes clips. Warning, this was a television news story on the production and is not the excellent behind the scenes documentary that aired on PBS. Obviously, my only complaint with this DVD is going to be the exclusion of that documentary, which, I supposed, belonged to PBS and not Sullivan productions. So, I know that most of you reading this not only already have "Anne of Green Gables" on videotape, you have had it for a long time. I am just here to tell you that picking up the DVD version as well is worth the additional expenditure.\n'

aS"\nI needed a small freezer for storing excess frozen blueberries from a bulk purchase so after researching different makes and models, I finally decided to purchase the Haier mini-freezer from Amazon. Amazon offered free shipping and the price of the unit was $20 cheaper than my local walmart and target. It was very good customer service for Fedex sending two employees to deliver the mini-freezer so it arrived in excellent condition even though the way the mini-freezer was packaged from Haier was the worst I've ever encountered. There was absolutely no foam or packing material to protect the unit and after cutting one plastic strap the card board box fell apart.\n  \n  After inspecting the unit for damage, I found one small dent near the top-right of the freezer door (See the images that I've posted above). I proceeded to follow the instruction booklet and plugged it in. I filled the mini-ice tray (Included with the unit) with water and left it in the freezer. Two hours later I checked to make sure the unit was still working and noticed the water had already frozen so now I have mini-ice cubes ^_^\n \n  I thought it would be helpful to include the mini-freezers interior measurements for usable space: I've measured the freezers interior top half at 15 inches wide with a depth of 12 inches, while below the removable wire shelf the bottom half measures 15 inches wide with a depth of only 7 inches (Usable space is lost due to the units motor).\n  \n Pros-\n The unit is very quiet.\n It looks nice and the handle is built into the top of the door.\n The hinge can be moved to the opposite side depending on which way you prefer the door to open.\n It has a switch in the back which allows temperature adjustment from 1-7 (I have it set on 4).\n It has a removable wire rack inside the freezer.\n \n Cons-\n Some of the space in the lower section of the freezer is lost to the units motor.\n \n I'm very happy so far with my purchase and recommend this mini-freezer to anyone that needs a little additional freezer space, but keep in mind there is a high percentage chance it will arrive with a dent >_&lt;.\n"

aS'\nI think \'Brown Sugar\' is a film that had a lot of potential with all the characterizations in it but failed to deliver as a blockbuster. For example, the movie tries (way too hard) to take you "back in the day" with the birth of Hip Hop. That is fine but for the one millionth and one time: How many times will Sanaa or Taye Diggs say \'Hip Hop\'? We get the point. The soundtrack could have been more documentary with Hip Hop/ Neo-Soul music from the 1980s to 2000s. \n \n Another the thing that I could not stand is the illecit love affair between Sanaa (Sydney) & Taye Diggs (Dre) characters, after Dre got MARRIED. It would have been nice to see them turn their friendship into a more than plutonic level, even after he proposed to Nicole Ari Parker\'s character. Afterall, she wasn\'t really in love with him in the first place, and he had made a rush of judgement. But sadly, he gets married and then Taye Diggs falls in love with his best friend. What about his wife?\n \n Finally, it would have been nice to see the Hip Hop Industry\'s B-Side present challenges that challenged their friendship. It was like a smooth ride love story with a twist of adultery, and the ending was too obvious. With a good romance, who cares about an obvious ending but at least give me some plots and intrigue and a reason to watch the film several more times. The ending made me shake my head! And with all the potential, this film did not deliver mainly because of adulterous themes and an annoying focus on \'Hip Hop\'.\n'

aS"\n I found this book very interesting. I'm British, but I take an interest in American politics. In this book ex-FBI agent Gary Aldrich relays his impressions and experiences of the Clinton White House. \n AS is obvious from some comments in reviews here, the fact that the book has the political arena as its background means some strong reactions will be stirred almost by default. \n \n But I did not find Aldrich was trying to score political points. His is actually something of a matter of fact analysis of more nuts and bolts issues surrounding the functioning of the White House. And he obviously cares very much about the dignity, efficiency and security of the place. And indeed, through his work he is obviously very knowledgeable about it. Which was one reason I found the book interesting, because it allows a glimpse into some of the basic mechanics of the place at the centre of American politics.\n \n But even though I guess political loyalties will be fired up, it is quite plain to me that the book transcends these, and is in fact about what endures in the system of government beyond them. And although some individuals might get hot under the collar because of political considerations, nevertheless I suggest persons of any political persuasion should really be able to see the issues run deeper.\n \n As for the reliability of the book, surely, the obvious basic fact of the matter is that Aldrich is an eminently credible and authoritative source. His job was to dispassionately and meticulously assess character in the highest office in the land for the sake of the standing of that office. A job he evidently took pride in, took very seriously indeed, did well and was respected for. It's obvious to me the man had Public Servant written all over him. I suggest he has proven a faithful servant to his nation.\n \n I do not sense political opprtumism in this book, but moral courage. Aldrich seems to me to be a decent guy who felt it wrong to just shut up. And in so doing he offers an affirmation of the existence of bedrock decency in law enforcement agencies, itself no small matter.\n \n I can't imagine he took the decision to publish lightly. It seems there was something very wrong in the corridors of power and Aldrich felt duty bound to alert the country. No matter what actual political persuasion Aldrich himself may have, this book is not in itself about that, and I think it's only reasonable to recognise this in assessing it. \n \n I think the book is actually well written, which is part of its effectiveness. But it's not the fancy writing of the novella, its that of the informed, matter-of-fact report. Aldrich cuts to the chase, and his style is fluid and concise, making it very easily readable.\n \n I highly recommend it. It obviously raises specific concerns, but more than that I think it raises fundamental questions about the nature of government in the USA; questions, for instance, pertaining to distinctions between process and personality, important issues when considering the mechanics of democracy.\n"

aS"\nThis book is quite simply a comic masterpiece, a novel brimming with original characters, absurd situations, and at its heart a blustery, vulnerable mama's boy named Ignatius J. Reilly. He is one of the most  startlingly original characters in modern fiction, and his efforts at  hitting the job market after his mother smashes their car will leave you in  stitches. A word on the history of the novel is worth mentioning here.   The author, John Kennedy Toole, committed suicide in 1969, and his mother  found the hand-written manuscript in her son's papers.  She brought them to  a publisher, who dreaded having to read even a portion of the work and to  notify Toole's mother that it stunk.  Instead, he was blown away by Toole's  draft, and the rest is history.  The novel earned him a posthumous Pulitzer  Prize, and it is universally hailed by critics. Trying to summarize the  plot is impossible - the book cannot really be categorized.  Ignatius is an  over-educated  oaf who stays home filling his writing tablets full of his  offbeat musings on ancient history, which he plans to organize and publish  some day but which presently reside all over his bedroom floor. Rome wasn't  built in a day he reminds himself.  He cites in footnotes, as authority for  some of his offbeat opinions, papers he had previously written and  hand-delivered to the local university library for inclusion into their  archives.  He watches dreadful tv shows and movies, howling at the screen  with a mixture of delight and loathing at the teenybopper drivel, and in  the privacy of his room his self-gratification is performed while imagining  visions of the old family dog. And wait til you see him out in public,  getting a series of odd jobs, including a filing clerk at Levy Pants (with  very innovative filing techniques to avoid crowded file space) as well as a  costumed hot dog vendor wandering around the French Quarter in a pirate  costume. All the while he begins work on his latest opus, The Journal of  the Working Boy. There is a latent sadness to the plot, for while you are  laughing out loud at Ignatius, his bowling-addicted mother, and the motley  crew of skillfully drawn supporting characters, you sense that he will  never really belong anywhere, and that he realizes his outcast status with  his innate intelligence. Perhaps the author felt the same way in 1969,  leading to his own suicide.   However, at least Toole did leave us A  Confederacy of Dunces, a novel which reveals more with each rereading.   Keep it on your shelf, and every now and then pick up the book to any page  and marvel at the absurdity of Ignatius's grandiose ramblings, read exerpts  of his bizarre historical writings, and revisit his comic efforts to  organize a worker's revolt at Levy Pants. The list goes on and on. There is  no work of litereature like it I know, and my only regret in reading Toole  is the sorrow felt in knowing the tremendous body of work that was lost  when he ended his life.\n"

aS'\nBelieve it or not, I had never owned a powered subwoofer until I purchased the "Onkyo SWK204" after researching what I might need to complete my sound system after adding a new Panasonic Plasma HDTV,  a Sony Blu-Ray DVD, and a new Sony receiver.  After a week of listening to the SW in my home, I am thrilled with the purchase. \n \n The "Onkyo SWK204" Bass Reflex powered subwoofer has a built in 230 watt amp which is more than adequate for the home theatre system I have installed in my large living/family room.  It is a 10" cone subwoofer that is attractive yet non intrusive in a basic black with silver cone and sturdy enough weighing in at 26 pounds.\n \n I am NOT a techie so I will only say that with so many of the new movie sound tracks containing low frequency emissions (LFE), I was astounded at the difference this SW made in my home entertainment enjoyment.  It has a frequency response of 25 Hz to 150 Hz and a continuously variable crossover (50Hz-200Hz) controlled by a cross over frequency control along with the customary volume control and a lighted standy mode.  \n \n There are certainly better and more powerful subwoofers out there and you will, of course, pay for the advanced power or features.  As a home audio/visual amateur, I found this unit to be an acceptable and efficacious choice based on performance and price.  \n \n \n'

That is about the only cons that come to mind.  App development has made a LEAP since I originally purchased the phone on launch date.  Gaming in particular has really come into it's own.  A lot of developers have given their approval, and starting to duplicate if not migrate their apps from the Iphone.  I have 0 regrets in purchasing this phone, and I'm really hard to please.  I am a bit biased as I insist on having a physical keyboard.

aS"\nI've been playing games for 20 years, and I honestly can't think of one quite as insane as Bayonetta. The character and level designs are gorgeous. The bosses are ridiculously huge, and there's lots of them. The combos and special moves are wicked and fun to pull off. And I actually liked that the soundtrack wasn't the typical heavy metal. The story is a little hard to follow, but you can seriously skip the cut scenes and still have an amazing experience.\n \n Now, I heard some negative things about this game before I bought it. The biggest one is that the Xbox version is far superior, allegedly. While I can't compare the two, I can honestly say I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the game. Yes, it has frequent load times. But, you know what? There's so much happening on the screen sometimes, I didn't mind the break. The graphics seemed a little low-res, but the inventive style more than made up for it. I will say, though, that if there is a sequel, I hope the PS3 port gets the development attention it deserves.\n \n A couple other things to consider: You can beat the game on easy in 8 or 9 hours (the difficulty is set so easy means normal and normal means you'll throw your controller a lot). If you want tons of play time for your money, you may want to rent this instead. Also, I'm aware some people are saying that the game is offensive. While the female characters are hypersexual, I didn't see a huge difference between this and something like Tomb Raider.\n \n Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's one of the most memorable I've played in a long time. The good stuff far outweighs the bad. There's a tsunami of amazing games gushing out this year, but don't overlook this one.\n \n \n"

aS"\nI highly recommend this book to anyone who is searching for answers to Life, the Universe and Everything (with apologies to Douglas Adams - read that one too!). Written with passion and insight it makes compelling reading. If you are an independent thinker, a quester for answers to the origin of the human race and one who has an open mind about the effect that mythology (religion) has had on human history, you will find this book enthralling. This book should appeal to atheists because it tells them that they no longer have to put up with mythologies foisting their views on them and they should be confident and proud to be an independent thinker. The book should also be read by creationists because how can you condemn it if you haven't read it? (Notice how many people condemn evolution without ever having opened a book of Darwin's and yet non adherents to mythology seem to have read many of the great mythological works such as the Bible). Read it. It may change your life. You won't regret it.\n"

aS"\nMy wife got me this for my birthday last month, and I was really excited about trying it out...which, like a kid with a new toy, I did almost immediately. The instructions are easy to follow and the components are easy to assemble and use -- I had my first batch (of 'Cowboy Lager') sitting in the keg after about 45 minutes of reading and work in the kitchen.\n \n The minimum amount of time the mix needs to sit in the keg is 7 days -- I let this first batch sit for 11. The longer the time in the keg, the more flavor it's supposed to develop. I bottled the mix -- 8 liters in all -- and that was another simple process, going exactly as described in the instructions. The beer has to ferment in the bottles for no fewer than 7 days in order to carbonate. My 8 bottles are still sitting, after 8 days. I plan on letting them sit for another week before putting them in the fridge so they'll be 'conditioned' in time for Christmas.\n \n I did, however, make an extra bottle from the first batch, in an extra bottle I had. I drained the keg almost dry to do it, even pouring in some of the sludge that had settled at the bottom. The stuff was orange and cloudy! I let that sit for the minimum 7 days, and let it condition in the fridge for only 1 (although the instructions recommend at least a week). I wanted to try something close to the minimum standard for the mix and the kit in general...and I have a mug of the stuff next to me as I type. Final verdict on this 'minimum mix' -- it's quite good! It was adequately carbonated, and produced a smooth head that had a nice smell and flavor. The beer itself is about the same color as a typical American brew -- Coors or Michelob -- and has a very light flavor, with a slightly dry aftertaste. It's something I could enjoy in the middle of summer. And remember: this, according to the instructions, is the swill. The better stuff will come out of those bottles that are going to ferment for another week before I cool them.\n \n I'm fired up! I made my next mix today -- American Blonde -- which was also included in the set. I'll let that sit in the keg even longer to see how the flavor develops. All in all, I'm really happy with this as a present, and even happier about what's it's produced. This isn't just a gift that seems cool: it's already exceeded my expectations.\n \n This section added on 8 June 2009: I'm now carbonating my 17th two-gallon batch. Yes, that's a lot of beer, considering that each batch makes 20-24 bottles, depending on how much water I decide to add (sometimes a little more if it's a heavy brew with a lot of ingredients). ANYWAY, I'm still as fired up about this thing as I was when I got it. We've bought two six-packs and one twelve-pack of beer from the store since December, and that was mostly to harvest bottles for future use. I do not miss buying beer at the store...mine is better, and cheaper, too. My only recommendation is to get 12-oz brown glass bottles, a hand-held capper, and O2 barrier caps -- then you can bottle your own 'normal' bottles, and you can reuse them. The 1-liter PET bottles that came with my set are fine, as they keep the carbonation well, but I don't like opening that much beer at once unless I have people over. Standard bottles are far more convenient. Mr. Beer rocks. That is all.\n"

aS"\nThis book is readable, informative and appears to be very well-documented.  As a former apologist for Bill Clinton, I have to say that this book was a revelation to me and frankly made me a little queasy.  I can't believe that I helped put this man in office.  Morris can speak with genuine admiration about many of the positive steps, but also chronicles the dark side in a way that many of my former fellows will find hard to accept.  Despite some significant accomplishments during his administration, there was confusion, ineptitude, cronyism, lack of vision, and downright corruption. \n I was on the one hand proud of Clinton for things like his extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which lifted so many low-income families out of poverty, and on the other hand absolutely enraged by the dithering and delay and lack of action in Afganistan, Iran, Iraq, Bosnia, and Rwanda that contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths, thereby emboldening Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda to commit acts of mass murder on our own soil.\n  \n I am left with the forlorn feeling that, with both the Clintons, there was always a lot less there than meets the eye.\n \n Allow me to apologize if you disagree with my perspective...my advisors made me write this...\n"

aS"\nThis is one of my top 10 favorite books EVER!  From their first amazingly hot encounter to the heart-wrenching conclusion I was hooked.  Regardless of the graphic nature of their sexual encounters and the explicit language, Lisa Valdez has written a compelling and well plotted story.  I appreciate that the author has revealed that the sex scenes are actually integral, and metaphorical, to the character's needs and their relationship with each other.  Mark, the Earl of Langley, has never been embraced or loved deeply by another woman and Passion is unfulfilled/unfilled--and both find their needs truly met in each other.  Understanding this may help a more reticent reader move beyond the shocking beginning and into the dynamic storyline that is alternately tragic and triumphant.  Readers may need to keep a box of tissues nearby during the last third of the novel. :)\n"

aS"\nOut of the big 4 thrash bands of the 80s, Megadeth has always been my favourite. Theyve had a great array of awesome albums, slightly altering their sound in the 90s but not as much as some (Ahem Metallica). Their last Greatest Hits release Capitol Punishments was a big disapointment though, mainly containing 90s singles and also 15 tracks including 2 new ones is not enough for a complete Best Of collection. So I had hopes for this one, being fan chosen to deal the goods. In some ways it does but its still lacking some essential songs. \n \n The album is presented in a completely random order but it probably is better then Capital Punishments newest to oldest tracklisting. Again there is more songs chosen from the 90s albums, being there is more of them but this still disapoints me. Only one song Mechanix from KIMB and only one from SFSGSW which definatly needed at least one more. Wheres Mary Jane or even Anarchy in the UK? Peace Sells gets one more song (Wake Up Dead) then it did on Capital Punishment which is pretty good but RIP has exactly the same as it had on Capital Punishment. I definatly would have included one more from that, it is widely regarded as their best album. \n \n Countdown to Extinction recieves 3 songs, Skin O' My Teeth which wasnt included on Capital Punishment but for the life of me i cant figure out why they chose this song over Ashes In Your Mouth which as well as being a far superior song recieved more votes on the [...] forums. But I guess final decision goes. Youthanasia recieves the 2 hits good songs but they dont measure up to Countdown to Extinction. Its great Angry Again was included from the out of print Hidden Treasures. From Cryptic Writings, Trust and She-Wolf. Trust was a big hit and She-Wolf was a fan favourite so its great to see it on here. Risk, the album where they apparently sold out recieves one favourite, Prince of Darkness which is a much better song then the Industrial flavoured Crush Em' that was on Capital Punishment. Next up is Kill the King, one of Mustaines favourites so we all knew it would be included although im not too pleased about it as it was the bonus track on Capital Punishment and not really needed here. Good song though. Then Dread and the Fugitive song, the only song included off The World Needs a Hero. Would have liked to see another song from that album on here because this was included on Capital Punishment as a bonus track as well.\n \n And thats where it ends. Yes nothing off The System Has Failed which is by far their best album since Youthanasia. I dont know what Mustaine was thinking but its obivous a 2cd package was needed to fully display all that Megadeth could be. Wheres Tornado of Souls, Devils Island, Maybe some live tracks or other classic Deth? Kick the Chair, Blackmail the Universe, Die Dead Enough or any song from The System Has Failed? The bonus DVD is all well and good but its pretty much just an extended teaser for the upcoming Arsenal Of Megadeth DVD. Its still a very good hits compilation if you want to get into megadeth or if you are a Megadeth completest but for your average fan its not really worth it. I would personally just skip any Greatest Hits CD and go straight to the studio albums, which is where the magic really happens.\n"

aS"\nFor $25 you can't expect much, but this is a good guitar considering the price. It was packed very well, but the strings that came with it were awful - they are difficult (if not impossible) to tune correctly, and they were very corroded when I received it.\n \n The solution was very simple - I bought a new set of strings for a regular guitar. Instead of tuning it like a standard guitar, tune it a fourth or a major third above standard tuning. This is perfect for the size of the guitar, and it sounds great. Remember to use very low gauge strings.\n"

This cable is the first in a series of nano-molecular para-polarized transparent aluminum cabling, soon to be standard in all Denon audiophile equipment.\n \n Since carefully installing the Denon cables using the provided surgical gloves, my system has stablized in Hilbert space. Apparently the Denon AKDL1 performs polarized nanoscale quantum tunneling by using a custom transparent aluminum cable matrix to push parameterized vorgon particles through a dark fibre phase variant Heisenberg compensator. How they accomplish this for only $500, I don't know. \n \n"

aS'\nSturdy and quite heavy for its size, this no-frills Bible is an excellent value, and would make a very good second or third Bible. Well constructed with an imitation leather look on the cover, the font size is not large, but it is in bold print, and very readable and easy on the eyes.\n What it has: \n A presentation page.\n "Daily Bible Readings," giving a table of three systems for reading the Bible in one year.\n A seven page history of the Bible, and how the King James Version came to be. First published in 1611, there were several subsequent revisions, and the version we read today is most like the 1769 revision.\n What it does not have that you would likely find in a better quality Bible:\n It has no cross-references, making it a poor Bible for study.\n The words of Jesus are not printed in red.\n It has no concordance.\n No maps.\n No ribbon marker.\n \n Many people use a modern language Bible for study, enabling greater clarity and understanding (and I recommend the New King James Version, or the one I have used for years, the Amplified Bible), but the King James Version is nevertheless glorious in its language, should be read at least once in a lifetime, and is invaluable for comparison of texts, and though I feel it is a sadly short-sighted view, some consider the King James Version as simply great "literature," comparing it to Shakespeare, and read it only for the beauty of its prose.\n Due to this edition not having cross-references, it does not make a good primary Bible, but will be more than adequate as a secondary translation, and the King James Bible is a version one should definitely own.\n \n Psalm 66:19\n King James Version: "But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer."\n New King James Version: "But certainly God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer."\n Amplified Bible: "But certainly God has heard me; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer."\n'

aS"\nI bought this phone to replace one I had that wasn't working well.  I need to say though that I do not use this with a gophone plan.  I have a regular family plan with AT&T and of course the customer service will not tell you that you can use a gophone as a replacement.  If you aren't eligible for an upgrade they will tell you that you have to buy one at full price, usually $200 & up.  Gophones work just fine, just don't use the sim card that comes with it, put in the one from your old phone.  It actually has directions inside the package that tells you how to use the gophone with your regular plan, and they credit the $50 airtime as like an extra 150 minutes to your plan.  As far as the phone, I couldn't be happier.  The slide feature is great with the qwerty keyboard and the battery life has been great.  We have three LG phones in our plan and they all use the same chargers, which is very convenient.\n"

aS"\nWireless works great.  Sound is decent from the size of the speakers.  I did hook it up to larger front towers, and that makes it excellent!  Overall this is a great device to go along with your LG tv.  One point of note, if you have this, you do not need the wireless dongle that is sold separately for the tv.  All the same features are in this device, ie. Netflix,Pandora,Vudu,etc.. the only draw back without using the dongle is you have to have this turned on and the sound will need to come from it rather than the tv.  Not really a big deal as you would probably want it on anyway if streaming a movie or music.  It will also turn on and off automatically with the tv, as well as turning the tv on when it is turned on.  Great thinking on LG's part.  Make sure you update the firmware as the menus are very slow without it.  Actually come to think of it, that was automatic after finding the network.  LG did a great job combining all these features into a tiny package.  I'm an Audiophile and never thought I would accept the sound quality of such a device, but come to find out I do!  All of my other equipment is high end, and I can honestly say for the price/features this device has, it delivers.  Build quality is ok for what it is.  I would have liked it to have a little more heft and a powered subwoofer rather than passive, but again given what it can do it's a nice piece of equipment.  If you are looking for a nice compact solution with decent sound for a living room I would go for it.\n"

aS"\nThis product has dramatically improved my quality of life.  It works exactly as described.  I did find it difficult to fit at first, but eventually succeeded after 3 tries:  the effort was worth it.  My wife and I began to sleep apart when my snoring became excessive.  I have Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), and like many others have tried and failed to use a CPAP machine.  While the vendor cannot legally claim to be selling a cure for OSA, I have found it to be a cheap and effective substitute for the CPAP.  I not only do not snore when I wear the mouthpiece, but I sleep more soundly as well.  I now wear it even while away on business trips because of the improvement in the quality of my sleep.  For those who have tried CPAP and can't tolerate it, I highly recommend trying this product.\n"

I was happy, then one day it wouldn't tune in my favorite FM radio stations. All my presets just wouldn't tune in.. there was nothing but static. I was confused because it just happened.. with no apparent reason and other stations would still come in fine. After playing with the unit and trying to figure it out, a buddy suggested I try to reset the head unit (a small button behind the face plate) and sure enough... that did it, I could receive my favorite channels again. \n \n As a follow up, I've had this unit for a couple years now and I love it.. really a great head unit.

aS'\nI have read 3 previous books by Mr. Norman ("The Bird Artist", "The Museum Guard" and "The Haunting of L.") and enjoyed them all very much. I therefore came to this book with high expectations, and they were not disappointed.\n \n Mr. Norman has a way with his stories of telling them in a calm and sure voice that reassures the reader while at the same time advancing the plot effortlessly. This plot involves a protagonist whose parents both commit suicide on the same day, by jumping from different bridges. He\'s then taken in by an Aunt and Uncle who have a daughter about his age. The uncle has a sled and toboggan making business, and our young man joins him in this.\n \n It is 1941 and, in Nova Scotia, the threat of ship sinking by German subs is never very far from everyone\'s thoughts.In fact, the uncle has become obsessed with it, and papers the wall of his workshop with newspaper clippins and pictures about subs and sinkings.\n \n The plot really takes off when the daughter brings home a young German student whose family fled to Denmark to escape the Nazis. Despite this, he is looked upon as a potential enemy by almost everyone in the small town where the action takes place. His arrival sets off a chain of events that is both tragic and heartfelt. To say more would be to ruin the book for potential readers.\n \n All that I can say is that, if you enjoy a small story with believeable characters that is told in an excellent way, you will definitely find this book to your liking. It is highly recommended!\n'

With her trademark wit and tenderness, she sweeps us into the topsy-turvy life of Jill Murray, a feisty single mom trying to stitch together a future after she and her little girl, Anastasia, are abandoned by her husband. SEVEN YEAR SWITCH explores love, loss, anger, recovery, and the surprising events that healed the hearts of a young mother and her daughter. \n \n The characters are fully developed, and each has endearing quirks, fobiles, and very real (sometimes delightfully convoluted) emotions.

aS"\nFunny, everyone seems so thrilled about how they come charged out of the box.  While this is nice and convenient, the bigger picture is *why* they can come charged out of the box: they discharge at a much slower rate than normal (NiMH) rechargeable batteries.  If you use your battery-needing product often, you may not notice this, but for things you use sporadically, this is a godsend.  No more coming home from vacation to find your TV remote control is dead.  No more grabbing your digital camera after three weeks of not using it only to find it won't start up.  \n \n These batteries are, indeed, the best of both worlds: they have the power and reuse advantages of a good NiMH battery, but the slow steady discharge of an Alkaline disposable.  Look no further -- this is the rechargeable you've been waiting for.\n \n And if you had to guess, I'm happy with my first set and about to order more... :)\n"

aS"\nAt first, people think this is some kinda sex-toy from the future. It's not. It's a beard trimmer. And a pretty good one to boot. If you're like me, you use your beard trimmer when you don't have much time in the morning before you have to take off for work. If you trim with this thing quickly on the 'normal' trimming mode, it'll catch maybe 75% of your hair in the vaccuum. However, when you enter warp speed (turbo mode) this thing is insane. It's really loud and sounds like it might explode, but it works great. It catches roughly 90-95% of hair in the vacuum in turbo mode. It's quite easy to take apart to empty out the little hair-catch-all and clean trimmer attachments or swapping them out (comes with a fine-line trimmer). The height adjustment doesn't seem quite as pronounced as my older Norelco trimmer (meaning you can obviously tell when it clicks into place...this one not so much) but it works nonetheless. I'm happy with it and recommend it to all who read this. Just be sure to take a minute out of your abnormally busy day to read the instructions and precautions and maintenance tips to prolong the life of this thing. That's what they're there for, after all.\n"

aS'\nI am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too.  This book, however, drove me nuts!  I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn\'t cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money.  This book is so terrible that I couldn\'t even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through.  Clearly, this book is one of Sophie\'s earlier works - the "plot" is terrible.  Don\'t waste your money - don\'t take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won\'t be able to return it!  Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella\'s novels instead - "Remember Me" is hysterical and a great, easy read.  "Cocktails for 3" is painful trash.\n'

I know this may sound lame, but it saved my @ss!!!  When cutting some tubing, my disk exploded at full RPM's and the shrapnel hit me in the goggles.

aS'\nThis Nuvi does several things very well, and I\'ve yet to discover any serious shortcomings.  My thoughts:\n \n Navigation: Excellent, as is typical with Garmin units. On a couple of occasions the voice (right now I\'m using Australian Karen) told me my destination was on the wrong side of the street.\n \n Map: The map is clear, the refresh rate is fast, and all of the right information is provided on-screen, including details for upcoming turns and junctions, speed limit, and traffic alerts. It\'s annoying that I can\'t choose to switch the display of my current speed to some other piece of info. I already have a speedometer. The 3D buildings feature seems pretty gimmicky, and is implemented sporadically, even in downtown Boston. When there is coverage, most buildings are monochromatic blocks, and not the photo-realistic buildings seen in screenshots.\n \n Lane Assist: This feature has been spot-on so far. It\'s nice driving in a new area and not getting flustered about being in the wrong lane. I have yet to see the full-screen 3D Lane Assist Junction View shown in the many 765t screenshots -- however, I\'ve done very little highway driving, and I believe this screen requires that the user press the top-left (upcoming turn icon).\n \n >>>>>UPDATE: After some highway driving, it turns out that the full-screen 3D Lane Assist Junction View shows up automatically before potentially tricky highway junctions. Very nice.\n \n Traffic: As far as I know, I have not been re-routed because of traffic. However, it\'s very easy to bring up a list of major roads and their current traffic conditions, and to avoid them at will. The pop-up advertising associated with the "free" traffic is pretty subtle, and never distracting.\n \n Bluetooth: I\'m impressed with this feature so far. It mated with my phone (old Motorola RAZR V3) easily, importing all of my contacts in the process. The ability to instantly dial any point of interest (e.g., to check on store hours) is brilliant. The volume from the speaker is reasonably loud. I also tried sending the audio to my car stereo using an audio cable, and the output seemed a bit low (I had to turn my car stereo way up). I have not yet tried sending the audio to my car stereo using the FM transmitter. I called my voicemail, and the built-in microphone picks up my voice reasonably well with the engine running. I\'m not sure how well it would work with highway speeds. I\'m told that the cheap Garmin microphone (which plugs into the cradle, not the unit) improves voice quality.\n \n >>>>>UPDATE: This is true -- the microphone is an improvement, though it adds yet another long cord to your long cord collection. Also, I\'ve tried the FM transmitter. It works, albeit with a certain amount of static. I imagine this feature would intolerable if you are driving a long way.\n \n Other features: I haven\'t used the SD card slot for anything. I haven\'t tried the photo viewer or the mp3 player, and I probably won\'t.\n \n Build Quality: Seems solid. The unit has a certain heft to it, and it\'s covered in a soft, rubbery coating. I\'ve also dropped it already (because I\'m an idiot) -- still working beautifully.\n \n Suggested improvements: Garmin doesn\'t make it easy to look up the actual coordinates (latitude and longitude) for favorites or points of interest. This information should be available at the press of a button.\n \n Needless to say, I\'m pleased with my purchase. The 756t is not cheap right now, and if you can live without the new features, you might be better off with an older unit. That said, if you\'re looking for a gps device with all of the latest features and compatibility, this seems to be a solid pick.\n'

The black box fits nicely with our other TV components. The Wii Resort software that comes with the package is so cool as a starter set that I haven't felt the need to purchase other software (yet). \n \n One game in particular has been the source of many hours of fun: Island Flyover. Why? Because it was easy to learn (I'm 55) yet well designed enough to keep me engaged looking for landmarks, white balloons to shoot, etc. Hey, is anyone aware of any other games like this one?

aS'\n"Brooklyn\'s Finest" is a remarkably entertaining and well-acted police drama from director Antoine Fuqua, who also directed the also outstanding police drama, "Training Day."\n \n The film focuses on three very different Brooklyn cops over the course of a week. Richard Gere plays Eddie, a hardened veteran just a week away from retirement. He has nightmares, he\'s separated from his wife, and he\'s just biding his time until his retirement. Ethan Hawke, the hero of "Training Day, plays a narcotics detective desperate to finance a new home to give a better life to his wife, children, and twins on the way. Don Cheadle plays Tango, an undercover cop, who is so deep undercover that he forgets who he really is, and to make matters worse, he now has to setup a high-level drug dealer who saved his life while he was undercover in prison. \n \n These examples of Brooklyn\'s Finest are all living on the edge, and they all go over the edge one way or another. The acting from these three is superb. Their performances along with Wesley Snipes as the drug dealer, Brian F. O\'Byrne as Hawkes\' best friend and partner, Shannon Kane as Eddie\'s hooker with a heart of gold, and a number of others, make this a very enjoyable, but powerfully sad and tragic film.\n'

aS"\nMark Levin has taken the principles of America's founding fathers and applied them to the pressing issues of the day (free markets, government spending, national security, and the environment) to make a compelling case for less government and more liberty.  He shows how the inevitable end of ever larger government is tyranny.  It is rare that a book about political philosophy can be made as interesting and accessible as this one.  I would recommend this book to conservatives, as well as to independents or progressives who want to understand the conservative way of thinking.\n"

aS'\nBased on reading Michael Lewis\' Liar\'s Poker and Moneyball, I wondered whether The Big Short would prove to be entertaining and informative.  If you\'ve read some of Lewis\' books, you might agree that the "entertaining" part would seem to be a reasonably safe bet.  It turns out, it is.  The Big Short is fast-paced, straightforward, conversational and salty--very much like his earlier works.  Indeed, if you didn\'t know Michael Lewis had written this book, you could probably guess it.  It is easy reading and very hard to put down.  In short (no pun), The Big Short doesn\'t disappoint in being entertaining.\n \n In a sense, this book is similar to Moneyball in that Lewis tells his story by following a host of characters that most of us have never heard of--people like Steve Eisman (the closest thing to a main character in the book), Vincent Daniel, Michael Burry, Greg Lippmann, Gene Park, Howie Hubler and others.\n \n How informative is the book?  Well, it may seem that Lewis has his work cut out for himself, since the events of the recent financial crisis are already well known.  More than that, lots of people have their minds made up concerning who the perps of the last few years are--banks and their aggressive managers, "shadow banks" and their even more aggressive managers, hedge funds, credit default swaps, mortgage brokers, the ratings agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Fed\'s monetary policy, various federal regulators, short sellers, politicians who over-pushed home ownership, a sensationalist media, the American public that overextending itself with excessive borrowing (or that lied in order to get home loans), housing speculators, etc.  The list goes on--and on.  Okay, so you already know this.  The defining aspect of this book, however, is that it asks (and answers) "Who knew?" about the impending financial crisis beforehand.  Who knew--before the financial crisis cracked open for everyone to see (and, perhaps, to panic) in the fall of 2008--that a silent crash in the bond market and real estate derivatives market was playing out?  Indeed, the good majority of this book addresses events that occurred before Lehman\'s failure in September of 2008.  In describing what led up to the darkest days of the crisis, Lewis does a good job helping the reader to see how the great financial storm developed.  All in all, this is an informative book.\n \n Interestingly, in the book\'s prologue, Salomon Brothers alumnus Lewis explains how, after he wrote Liar\'s Poker over 20 years ago, he figured he had seen the height of financial folly.  However, even he was surprised by the much larger losses suffered in the recent crisis compared to the 1980s, which seem almost like child\'s play now.\n \n For a taste of The Big Short, Steve Eisman was a blunt-spoken "specialty finance" research analyst at Oppenheimer and Co., originally in the 1990s, and he eventually helped train analyst Meredith Whitney, who most people associate with her string of negative reports on the banking industry, primarily from late 2007.  Giving a flavor of his style, Eisman claims that one of the best lines he wrote back in the early 1990s was, "The [XYZ] Financial Corporation is a perfectly hedged financial institution--it loses money in every conceivable interest rate environment."  His own wife described him as being "not tactically rude--he\'s sincerely rude."  Vinny Daniel worked as a junior accountant in the 1990s (and eventually worked for Eisman), and he found out how complicated (and risky) Wall Street firms were when he tried to audit them.  He was one of the early analysts to notice the high default rates on manufactured home loans, which led to Eisman writing a 1997 report critical of subprime originators.  Michael Burry (later Dr. Michael Burry) was, among other things, a bond market researcher in 2004 who studied Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, and who correctly assessed the impact of "teaser rates" and interest rate re-sets on subprime loans.  In 2005, Burry wrote to his Scion Capital investors that, "Sometimes markets err big time."  How right he would be.\n \n Greg Lippmann was a bond trader for Deutsche Bank, who discussed with Eisman ways to bet against the subprime mortgage market.  Before home prices declined, he noted, for example, that people whose homes appreciated 1 - 5% in value were four times more likely to default than those whose homes appreciated over 10%.  In other words, home prices didn\'t need to actually fall for problems to develop.  (Of course, home prices fell a lot.)  When Lippmann mentioned this to a Deutsche Bank colleague, he was called a Chicken Little.  To which, Lippmann retorted, "I\'m short your house!"  He did this by buying credit default swaps on the BBB-rated tranches (slices) of subprime mortgage bonds.  If that\'s not a mouthful, read further in the book for a description of Goldman Sachs and "synthetic subprime mortgage bond-backed CDOs."  Then there\'s the AIG Financial Products story, told through the story of Gene Park, who worked at AIG, and his volatile boss, Joe Cassano.\n \n Did I say this book is informative?  Here\'s a bit more:  Did you know that a pool of mortgages, each with a 615 FICO score, performs very differently (and better) than a pool of mortgages with half of the loans with a 550 FICO score and half with a 680 FICO score (for a 615 average)?  If you think about it, the 550/680 pool is apt to perform significantly worse, because more of the 550 FICO score loans develop problems.  Think about how that got gamed.\n \n There\'s more, but hopefully you\'ve gotten the point.  This is a very interesting, entertaining and informative book that accomplishes what it sets out to do.  Chances are you\'ll enjoy it.\n \n'

aS'\nSam Wasson\'s just-released and delightful book on the making of "Breakfast at Tiffany\'s" is so chock-full of great anecdotes that you\'re sorry when it\'s over.  For awhile, you are there - a privileged insider-witness to a marvelous bygone moment in moviemaking history - and it\'s with a feeling of bittersweet regret that you step from its closing pages back into a realm of noisy 3D sequels and superfluous comic book franchises. Everything you\'d want to know and more is delivered in the book, from the reader\'s coverage producer Marty Jurow was first handed, re: adapting Capote\'s book for the screen ("In any event this is more of a character sketch than a story. NOT RECOMMENDED") to the guest list for the post-premiere party (including such unlikely elbow-rubbers as Dennis Hopper, Buster Keaton, Charles Laughton, and Jane Mansfield).\n \n A delicious through-line in the book is how close the movie came to not coming out so well as it did, with such jaw-droppers as everyone\'s resistance to having Henry Mancini write a song for the thing (eventual collaborator Johnny Mercer\'s original lyric, we learn, one of three eventually presented to Mancini, was called "Blue River").  An intimate exploration of the myriad personalities in conflict and collusion when a casual classic is being created, the book is cannily adept at detailing the logic of the so many minute decisions that lead to what we now accept as inevitable.  Of course Audrey Hepburn played Holly Golightly, you think, until you hear how hard Capote lobbied for Marilyn Monroe.\n \n Wasson is a formidable researcher.  He doesn\'t so much know where the bodies are buried as he knows where the hearts and minds are hidden.  The book is written like a good novel, taking you inside the consciousness of its characters with an impressive, insight-laden believability ("Fifth Avenue"\'s only recent movie-book rival in this regard is Mark Harris\' fascinating "Pictures at a Revolution"). And Wasson\'s notes on how he arrived at, and can justify, his leaps of imagination and empathy are almost as interesting as the text itself.\n \n Of course the book has its thesis and theories as well, positing "Breakfast at Tiffany\'s" and Hepburn\'s stylish, fresh, era-defining performance as a watershed moment in cultural history.  If you\'re a fan of Audrey Hepburn, the book is a must-have, because Wasson\'s astute take on what she was about, what she was up against, and how she delivered the goods strikes me as definitive.  Her spritely, near-angelic spirit comes alive in the pages of this eminently devour-able book, which is kind of an awesome dividend.\n \n'

aS"\nI can't believe someone would actually want to read about some the grotesque & obscene gestures going on throughout the book. I found it not only confusing with the way the author jumped around form event to event, but down right salacious in content & depressing as well. In my opinion reading is suppose to be either an adventure that takes you out of the ordinary life, or informative. This was just down right excess jibber jabber. It was overboard & weird! \n No thank you... I will not read another book by this author again anytime soon!\n"

aS"\nThis is a chick flick masquerading as an erotic thriller.  A rather sappy love story is the center of the movie and there's very little suspense. The only reedeming feature is Alyssa Milano's performance as Lily. She's really good and I must admit her nude scenes are also very sexy.  The DVD contains no extras. It would have been interesting to have included interviews and behind the scenes. All in all, a movie for Alyssa Milano fans only.\n"

aS"\nI bought this scanner to scan in about 150 old black and white family photos, and they all came out very nicely. I scanned only a handful of color pictures, and they were fine as well.\n \n Some experiences I had using the scanner:\n - smaller pictures end up getting a better final resolution\n - the quality is great for pictures, but only average for text; for example newspaper articles don't scan well enough to allow you to read smaller text\n - I was able to scan aout 30 pictures in an hour\n - scanning multiple photos is usually easy: you don't have to crop a big image into the individual photos because the scanning software figures out the picture boundaries. However, occasionally the picture boundary detection stuff messes up and the scanner detects 1 fewer picture than was in the scanner, forcing you to rescan \n \n For some old polaroids, the scanned picture was clearer and brighter than the polaroid. it brought out the picture in\n an amazing way.\n"

aS"\nI think this is definitely my favorite book that I've read so far by Jennifer Weiner.  As much as there were sad things happening, it was uplifting at the same time.\n \n I really liked all of the characters.  They completely seemed real to me.  I kept thinking of Sylvie, the mom, and relating her to my mom.  And how my mom is always there backing up my dad and how if my dad was unfaithful I could see the next series of events unfolding the same way they did in the book.  I could also relate to a little bit of something in each of the sisters.  They were both so different and started off so far apart emotionally but grew towards each other.\n \n I thought the plot seemed very realistic.  And I loved the little pop culture/current events tidbits that were in the story.  Some are so recent that I think its incredible that they're in the book.  And I think that some women might not like the ending with Sylvie, but I did.  Without giving away what happens, I think I would have made the same choice that she did.  A great summer read!\n \n"

aS"\nRemedy Entertainment announced Alan Wake all the way back in 2005 during the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo. Since then it's popped on and off of people's radars at sparing intervals, and now that it's finally been released, it seems as if Duke Nukem Forever should be only just around the corner. It can then only be described as fortunate that with such a long development period, Alan Wake has turned out to be a compelling and rewarding title to experience.\n \n The game's protagonist holds the title's namesake, and is presented as a highly-successful suspense-thriller novelist who -- with due thanks to an extended case of writer's block -- hasn't managed to put words to paper in the two years since his last release. He and his wife Alice take off to the quaint town of Bright Falls, nestled within the mountains, in an effort to get away from the fast-paced New York lifestyle, and to give Alan a change of scenery and a chance to get over his ailment. After a brief argument between the two, Wake's wife disappears, and the writer begins finding pages to a manuscript for a novel he hasn't written yet. What's worse is that the horrors scribed into the document begin occurring in earnest, and all of this sets off a mystery that's much bigger than Alan Wake himself.\n \n The driving force here is undoubtedly the unyielding fiction backing the whole of the package. There's nothing particularly profound about the narrative, but the means through which it's delivered is striking. The main bits of Alan Wake's story occur through traditional cutscenes, but you as the player will come across transcript pages, radios, and televisions, all of which will give tremendous insight into the past, present, and even future events surrounding your actions. It's not impossible to grasp the entirety of the plot's intricacies without these easter eggs of information, but there's no doubt that they assist incalculably with coloring in the dark and dreary world that would otherwise only be outlined.\n \n There are some very story-centric portions of the game that take place during the daylight hours, but you'll spend the bulk of your time transversing Bright Falls and its outlying woodlands by night. That's when all the spooky stuff happens. There are these dark-enshrouded creatures called the Taken, and there isn't a single one of them that would pass up an opportunity at putting an axe in Wake's spinal column. Fortunately they do have a weakness, that being anything fluorescent in nature, and resultingly you'll spend a lot of time fumbling around with a flashlight. There's nothing overly complex about the gunplay; burn away the darkness surrounding the Taken, and pop them a couple of times with a weapon of choice. There are bigger, badder enemies, but the only variation they apply is the longevity of your aforementioned actions.\n \n It's the simplicity and redundancy of the combat that serve as Alan Wake's only real drawback. Nothing about how you dispose of your night-stalkers ever really changes through the game's ten hour run. There's some stronger enemies, some faster ones, and even some malevolent demon crows to dispatch of. There are some possessed objects that'll fly at you, and a few pieces of heavy farm equipment that make it their sole duty to run you down, but the process undergone to remove the threat is essentially the same regardless. This isn't to say that there's no fun to be had with the shooting; you've got plenty of ways to make things entertaining for yourself, from flare guns, to flashbang grenades, to hunting rifles. But if simply switching out your weapons every once in a while doesn't help you in disguising the action, you're likely to find yourself a little burned out with the repetitive temperament of the rather frequent combat encounters.\n \n There's a thin layer of visual fidelity coating the town of Bright Falls, but all of that mostly emerges during the odd daylight segment. Everything looks pretty good at best, passable at worst. There's some stiffness and irregularities to the character motions, especially when you tell Wake to climb just about anything. The characters usually aren't all that prone at keeping their lips synced with the excellent voice acting, which is distracting during cutscenes.\n \n Where the game is at its best is when it has free aim to showcase its lighting effects. I'm still not sure if they're the best I've seen in a game, or if it just seems that way given how much of a staunch presence they have in the world. Headlights, street lamps, and even the gentle blinking of a computer terminal all stand as beacons of attention as you wander through the roads and forests. You'll even find that bounding through certain of these restore Wake's health and trigger a checkpoint. These effects all invite a sense of hope and an even stronger sense of environment into a world where your primary enemy does its best to conceal both.\n \n It's the strong deliverance of the narrative and a clear sense of place that lend their hand to making Alan Wake the game that it is. The constant conflict with the Taken eventually leaves something to be desired, but that just makes it all the more baffling that the game can get away with being as compelling as it is. There's a good time to be had with Remedy's latest, and there's little to regret about spending the full duration and seeing it through to the end. Just be sure and pack an extra flashlight and revolver, because Wake always seems to be forgetting his.\n"

aS"\nFinding Nemo is the fifth installment for Pixar Studios, the most reliable studio in Hollywood today, and it is my personal favorite.  The first obviously outstanding aspect of the movie is the animation.  From the breathtaking wonder of the Great Barrier Reef, to the cold, sterile fish tank, the animation is top notch and truly state of the art.  The water, which has always been the bane of animation, is picture perfect, and the animators have captured the rolling but constant ocean and the light refractions perfectly.  But animation itself doesn't make a film. Finding Nemo's strongest aspect is it's warm, witty, heartfelt, and funny story of a father's quest to reclaim his son.  The kids will love the vibrant characters and funny situations, and so will the parents.  However, the parents will be able to enjoy the film on a level far more than the kids will.  The story is about losing a child, and the desperate quest to be reunited, which will hit the parent right in the gut. This is the story's dark side, which has, thankfully, not been sugar coated by the creators.  Overall, lets just say Halleluja, Pixar, you've done it again!\n"

aS"\nIf you're thinking about buying a subwoofer, it is unlikely that you are a garden variety movie fan or lover of music.  People looking for subwoofers usually already have a decent system, but know that there is something lacking.\n \n When it came for me to buy one, three factors weighed in my decision: power, brand, and (of course) price.  I've grown up with what I have always believed to be a 'healthy skepticism' when it comes to Sony products.  My father had an early generation (1990ish) 5.0 Sony 250 Watt surround amp that performed extremely poorly in just about every function.  The only advantage it had over his earlier (1978) Rotel non-tube amp is that it had multiple component inputs.  The sound quality of the 50 Watt rated Rotel amp blew the Sony out of the water.\n \n In my search for a subwoofer, I was surprised to find so many good reviews of the Sony line.  I was looking for a better name than Sony, but when I compared prices, I was compelled to give the Sony at least a listen.  Comparable subs by Velodyne and others were far more expensive (double the cost of the Sony or more).  Listening to the Sony at the stereo shop, I must say that I was extremely impressed.  \n \n Is the Sony sound as good as the Velodyne or other high end subwoofers that cost 2-3 times as much as the Sony?  Of course not, but I quickly discovered that difference in sound quality was not at all closely related to the difference in price.\n \n Keep in mind that this is one of Sony's smallest and lightest subs (only 25 lbs), but once I brought it home and hooked it up to my 6.1 surround system and configured the frequency and volume on the back of the sub, it seamlessly expanded the low end range of my system for music and movie playback.  Before I learned (by experimenting with them) how to adjust the levels on the back of the sub, it was quite boomy and there was a bit of a gap between the low end on the six surround speakers and where the sub picked up.  When I made the appropriate adjustments, by trial and error, I found that this sub is an extremely versatile fit for my home.  My family room is 17'x14', and the back opens into a 10'x15' living room, and the sub easily fills the room.  When I crank the system for rock and roll music and movies, the sub has no problem keeping up and is easily capable of playing more loudly than is safe or enjoyable.\n \n Would I have liked a bigger sub made by a better brand?  Sure, but this one does the job (and then some) admirably, and for less than half the cost.  This sub gets 4 stars as a product, but I gave it 5 because of the extremely good value.  If you have a big budget and can afford to spend what it would take to buy a speaker that actually sounds better than one of these Sony subs, go for it, you will not be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you would rather spend less on a sub and still get excellent power and sound quality, this is as good as it gets without spending several hundred dollars.\n"

aS'\n M.A.S. Abdel Haleem\'s English translation of the Qur\'an is the best that I have seen. Some of the other English translations available, use awkward forms and archaic words that are difficult and tedious for the modern reader. But Haleem\'s translation is easy to read, yet scholarly. His footnotes, chapter intro\'s, and the historical background preface, is highly informative to the western reader; who may not be familiar with the history of Islam.\n \n My problem is not with the translation, it is with the book itself. For a supposedly holy book, the Qur\'an is rife with errors. Take for example Chapter 20 (Ta Ha), where Pharaoh supposedly tells his magicians that for their betrayal to Moses, they\'ll be crucified. The Exodus took place around the 14th century B.C. however, crucifixion was not invented until the 6th century B.C. by the Persians. In chapter 58 (The Dispute) Allah permits lying, but he damns those who "knowingly" lie. Does that make any sense? The Quran also permits hitting women ch 4:34, lying (because Allah is a liar ch 3:54), Jihad (holy war against non-Muslims ch 3:168-175), and in no uncertain terms damns those who believe that Jesus is God (Christians) ch 4:170-173. The Qur\'an is also very anti-Semitic. \n \n The Qur\'an does not even compare to the Bible in: reliability, historicity, complexity, beauty, or applicability. No, the Qur\'an seems like a jumbled collection of chapters that are highly repetitive and lack any real sense of order or flow. The Allah of the Qur\'an takes delight in damning the non-believers, and repeatedly states that those who "ascribe partners with God" (Christians and the Trinity for example), will be damned.\n \n Don\'t believe me? I took notes throughout the entire book, noting the errors, contradictions, and hateful theology that are found in the Qur\'an. I challenge others to do the same.\n \n So people need to read the Qur\'an before thinking that Islam and Christianity are compatible, because clearly they are not! The Jesus of the Qur\'an is a prophet; the Jesus of the Bible is God, big difference people!! And it doesn\'t stop there! Haleem\'s translation is good, but the book that he translated is not!!!\n \n \n'

aS"\n&quot;The Sun also Rises&quot; made a huge impression on me when I read it as a college student a number of years ago.  It is true that one must look beyond the surface to get a clear understanding of any book by Hemingway.   It is also true that the language that he used was not flowery, nor overly  eloquent but the meaning revealed within the lines.  It is also true that  the characters are often expatriates; living on the fringe of society and  hedonistic to the max.  All of those elements are visible here, yet  sometimes it might require a magnifying glass to see it.  However, these  are the qualities which make Ernest Hemingway, the seminal writer for a  generation and certainly one of the best.      I propose one hint when  reading &quot;the Sun also Rises.&quot;  Pay close attention to the  relationship between Barnes and Robert Cohn.  Barnes laothes Cohn for being  everything that he is not.  What drives him over the edge (in the inner  sanctum of his own mind and demons) is the success Cohn has insofar as his  relationship with Lady Brett.  Barnes is impotent and this is a crushing  blow to his manhood.  The tragedy here is his inability to consummate a  sexual relationship with her.  It destroys him--yet he is still accepting  of his predicament.  This is what allows this character to maintain  &quot;grace under pressure&quot;-- as Hemingway once coined the  term or  the ability to stand or hold ones ground when all odds are against you.   Certainly this can be a tragic flaw for any of Hemingway's male  characters--the total loss of his virility.  Yet he stands his ground and  never loses it.  He just hates Cohn from a distance and rationalizes that  he (Cohn) is one who cannot do anything just for the sake of doing  it---whether it be drinking, winning the Princeton boxing title, or being  in love with Brett.  It is complicated but one can come away with these  qualities after finishing the novel rather than while reading it.      I  think his friend and sometimes rival, F. Scott Fitzgerald, summed him up  best when he said of Hemingway: &quot;He's the real thing.&quot;\n"

aS"\nPete Townshend possibly feels a lot like David O. Selznick, the producer of the movie `Gone With The Wind' in fearing that he will only be remembered in his obituary by his creating that one work, as Townshend, like Selznick, seems to have been spending his time after completing their most important work in trying to top it.\n \n To my mind, Townshend should have no regrets about not topping `Tommy', as it is easily one of the two or three most important albums and works in the entire Rock canon, similar in importance and possibly superior in quality to `Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' and `Blond on Blond', to name just two others high in the ranks of great Rock albums.\n \n One thing which surprises me about writing on `Tommy' is how little deep analysis has been essayed about the story behind the songs. In a nutshell, the story is this:\n \n Tommy Walker is born while his father is off on some journey (`It's a boy') from which he becomes several years late in returning. Tommy's mother takes up with a lover, father returns, mother and lover kill father with Tommy as a witness, and mother and lover tell Tommy he saw and heard nothing (`You didn't hear it'). Tommy becomes functionally blind, deaf, and dumb to all outside appearances, however, it is evident that within his own head, he can see and hear everything (`There's a doctor I've found'). He is tormented by various malicious relatives (`Cousin Kevin' and `Fiddle About') and `treated' by various attempts, including hallucinogens (`Acid Queen'). As he grows up, the only outside experience to which he responds is a pinball machine, at which he becomes expert (`Pinball Wizard'). Tommy is finally cured by watching his image in a mirror smashed by, I believe, his mother's lover (`Smash the Mirror'). Being released from his isolation for Tommy is like being released from a practically lifelong mystical experience heightened by pinball. The charisma with which Tommy is imbued by this experience leads him to become a `New Messiah' (`Sally Simpson') creating a movement which expands beyond local resources (`Welcome') and becomes institutionalized into a ritual modeled after playing pinball while deaf dumb and blind (`Tommy's holiday camp'). The story ends with a revolt of Tommy's disciples against his new religion (`We're not gonna take it').\n \n The theme of being oppressed runs throughout practically all of Townshend's work, although in `Tommy', it takes a back seat to mysticism. The people who dote on the philosophical background of  `The Matrix' should sink their teeth into the `Tommy' story and ruminate on that a while. The major musical theme of the work seems to be Townsend's search for a magical chord. And, anyone who, like myself, has seen `Tommy' performed live by the original Who will have no trouble believing Townsend has found his chord as he hits that first great whirlwind chord in `Pinball Wizard'. Talk about a rush! In general, a lot of the music echoes earlier Who works. Townshend seems to constantly cut and paste phrasings from one work to another and I have no problem with this except in the most tedious of the three instrumental pieces (`Underture') in the album.\n \n Some writers have said that 'Tommy' is more like an Oratorio or a Song Cycle than it is an Opera, but I disagree. Neither of these other two genres requires a plot, and an Opera does, and Tommy has a plot. I prefer to think of it as a selection of arias and instrumental passages from which some bridging dialogue has been left out. My biggest problem with this plot is that the actual event that triggers Tommy's autism is only hinted at in the most vague of terms. It is easy to believe that it was a murder, but the lyrics of `You Didn't Hear It' never come even close to saying exactly what the event was. On the other side of the coin, the great majority of the songs on the album `Tommy' directly support carrying the story forward. Practically the only exception is the Sonny Boy Williamson classic `Eyesight to the Blind'. It is probably symptomatic that only `Pinball Wizard', `I'm Free', and `Sensation' out of the 24 cuts in `Tommy' really work for the Who outside the context of the whole work. That's why I'm especially happy to have seen The Who perform virtually the whole album live, four days after it was initially released. It is also interesting to see that the two cuts describing episodes of sadism were written by Entwistle and not Townshend.\n \n This CD contains exactly what was on my original vinyl two record album bought in 1969, suitably enhanced with modern electronics. My greatest respect for Townshend is for creating a classic musical form, the Opera, using an entirely ROCK instrument, with the slightest classical leavening from John Entwistle's French horn on a few early numbers. So many `rock' versions of traditional forms simply overlay rock performances on classical arrangements or make classical arrangements of rock melodies. Aside from `Quadrophenia', the only other work which succeeds at doing this is Spooky Tooth/Pierre Henry work `Ceremony An Electronic Mass'.\n \n Listening to this album and every other early Who album reminds one just how much their performances were a collaborative effort between the original four, and how much we miss Keith Moon and John Entwistle today. We can only say that with `Tommy' and numerous other works and recorded performances, the memory of The Who will live forever.\n \n Seminal work in the history of Rock.\n \n"

This story illuminates this fact, as we enter the world of Kino, a pearl diver and occasional fisherman, his wife Juana, and their baby son, Coyotito. All they have is a grass shack house, a few clay cooking utensils, and their prize possession, Kino's boat, inherited from his father and grandfather. The boat is the family's livelihood, providing the means to put a meal on the table and to provide a few pesos for store bought goods by selling the small pearls Kino is able to find. But Kino and his family, far from being depressed or unhappy, have a great treasure, the love they have for each other and their satisfaction with life as it is, with few disturbing dreams of greater things. But their quiet, routine life is turned upside down the day that Kino finds a Great Pearl. Suddenly Kino can dream of better things: a rifle for himself, school for his son so he will be able to read and tell what is really in the books, a real house. But dreams can be deadly things. Dreams lead to desire, and desire to greed, and greed to violence. What happens to Kino and family from this point on is not a pretty story. Now we see that underneath the quiet, idyllic seeming small town and its inhabitants lie the seeds of cheating, betrayal, collusion, fear, and murder. And we see the gradual loss of Kino's real treasures. By the end of the book, events have reached the level of real tragedy, and you, along with Kino, are liable to end up in a state of emotional exhaustion. Steinbeck's prose for this book matches his characters and situation very well, a very minimalist sentence structure and set of speech patterns. As a parable, the story has a strong moralistic point, but Steinbeck does not overdrive his thematic message, but lets his story speak for itself. One of Steinbeck's great strengths was his ability to capture on paper the characters he saw around him, and this book is a showcase for that talent. The characters of Kino and Juana are exquisitely drawn, real people you can relate to even though their lifestyles may be very far from your own. And because they are real people, it is very hard not to get drawn into their lives, where their dreams and their pains very readily become your own.  This may not be Steinbeck's greatest book, as it is too short and with too limited a focus to compare to something like his Grapes of Wrath. But within its own territory, there are very few other pieces of literature that are even half as good.\n"

aS"\nGiven the rave reviews, I had expected a bit more out of this product. My carpet is light gray, so just about everything shows. It does clean up most spots with a varying degree of repeated applications, but there are those that it just doesn't have much of an effect on.  (My cats have a tendency to cough up some hairballs that come with food stains--salmon is especially tenacious.  One of them somehow manages to get the hairball-prevention goop from her paw onto the carpet in small amounts.  Surprisingly, the cleaner does quite well in getting those up when they do not respond to the Oxy Deep spray method.) I do like that I can clean smaller high traffic areas, such as the transition areas from the carpet to the tiled rooms (kitchen, bathroom) to help keep them fresh.  I have purchased a different cleaning solution, supposedly of a higher cleaning ability, so perhaps that will remedy those spots that are less responsive to the sample that came with the unit.\n \n It's easy to use and clean and fairly portable.\n"

aS"\nWe bought this to replace an early-model netbook and are amazed at the improvements newer models have applied.  We carefully compared several models, including other stock models from HP sold by Amazon, and determined this one was the best bang for the buck.\n \n My wife and I are authors and primarily use this for word processing, but also use it for in-bed media (Hulu/Netflix) and gaming (old school games with minimal requirements).  The keyboard size was an initial concern for us, because we never fully adapted to the really small keys of our previous netbook, but upon receiving the unit, we had no problems adapting to the keys in any way.  \n \n The screen is very bright by default and we have not had the glare or underlit problems we have had on other screens.  We have successfully used the HDMI connector on several different TVs without any issues.  The speakers can get decent volume, but the quality isn't too great.  Most of our media runs just fine.  Flash Player 10.1 is supposed to increase the speed of video playback of certain types, but we didn't experience a significant gain, but it could be user error/browser choice/etc.  Netflix runs just fine and Hulu runs perfectly in its normal size, but full screen it chugs.\n \n I'm not thrilled with the power adapter plugging into the left side of the machine (prefer it in the back), but with the long battery life with minimal performance degradation, I just leave it out, even if a plug is nearby.  My wife, however, is just fine with its placement, mostly the aesthetics of having the sleek back.\n \n Speaking of the aesthetics, the shell casing is very attractive and does not collect as many smudges/fingerprints as we would have thought.  The unit is very light with enough stability that we don't worry about crushing the screen against the keys if we squeeze too hard.  We're able to tote it around the house and on quick trips without feeling any burden physically or time-wise.\n \n Some of these pros are relevant to netbooks as a whole, but this particular build with a REAL version of Windows 7, extra RAM, and upgraded hard drive make it a winner.  The processor is the lesser of the two major Atoms, but I doubt anybody would be able to realistically discern a difference even in a side-by-side test.  We love it!\n"

aS'\nJust received my new Aria last night. This is my first ever Android phone - Full Disclosure: I am coming from an old Blackberry & Moto Slvr so I am not exactly on the bleeding edge of smartphone development. My initial impression after about 4 hours of use is - fantastic phone!\n \n Things did not get off to a good start however when I couldn\'t get the phone apart to put the battery and SIM card in. I found the trick was to put my fingernail into the slot where you are supposed to split the phone apart and slide it to the left and right to get the top catches to release - others have said pushing the front out by pressing on the speakerphone in back while also using the slot works but I was hesitant to do that.\n \n The size and weight are perfect for my needs as I didn\'t want something the size of the Spring Evo 4G, etc. Although the big displays on that phone and similar phones are great I just felt they were too big for my daily use (and I had to stay on AT&T). The upside is with the resolution on this screen on a physically smaller screen than say my son\'s iPhone 3G the "crispness" of the display (especially text) is super.\n \n Physically the phone feels fantastic in hand and the build quality is excellent.\n \n Regarding the two primary AT&T induced drawbacks...no sideloading and AT&T bloatware: for the average user those are probably minor to non-issues. There are workarounds for both issues - the phone has already been rooted (check any of the Android developer forms) and custom ROMs are even available with the AT&T "features" removed. I was going to wait a few more weeks to let the hardware gurus fully explore the phone before making any modifications - but I really want that Swype keyboard.\n \n After a look at some of the AT&T software I think I might have to agree with some of the conspiracy crowd that AT&T would rather not be forced to deal with Android. Initial opening of the AT&T Hotspot app and the page is not centered?? Come on AT&T - at least make it look like you are trying! Sorry - I have been ticked off with AT&T from day one with regard to Android as I never understood how it was in their interest to NOT sell a phone that their customers want given the REAL revenue is in the two year data agreement - not the hardware.\n \n Lots more to explore but I don\'t think you will be disappointed with the Aria (especially at Amazon\'s price) if you decide to purchase one.\n'

aS"\nGood price, service and very fast shipping. Not really happy with this product cause it states that it can handle up to 8 lbs and in reality, it can't. I have 7 lb speakers that have stressed them to the point of almost failure (when mounting on the wall). After changing the mounting position from the side wall to the ceiling they are handling it much better. These mounts are only good for small speakers (like Bose) when wall mounting. If you are going to use them for heavy (capacity maxed) speakers, you should hang them from the ceiling.\n"

I was wary about purchasing the battery from pyrus electronics since it was so cheap.  Nonetheless, the battery arrived on time and it works perfectly fine. When the battery is fully charged, I get about five to seven hours of power (depending on screen brightness, active programs, etc.).\n \n Also, my battery fit perfectly into the slot.

aS"\nI've had these dvds for about a six months now and am very happy with the purchase.  My favorite out of the enire collection is definately DVD #2, Fit to Strip.  Carmen and her trainer take you through a total body workout that is super easy to customize for your own time limits or fitness level.  The segment menu makes it a breeze to navigate the DVD and choose to do one or all of the programs available.  You can sweat through an hour long workout or spot tone as you please.  I'm even impressed by the option to choose your own background music for each routine!  I recommend starting out with the basic cardio and floor work routines, then working your way up to the entire DVD.  That's how I approached it and am very happy with the results I've seen.  \n \n I certainly recommend purchasing the entire set of Aerobic Striptease DVDS.  However, if budgeting is a concern, the Fit to Strip DVD is well worth the money spent on it!\n"

aS'\nDid you know that your liver is the size of a football and weighs about 5 pounds?  Me neither... Well, I do now.  But believe me, there\'s a whole lot more information in this book that little tidbits like that (hehe).  That "slim-fast" drink diet has nothing on a live juice fast!  If you wanna do things right, get this book and do it right! Your liver is the hardest working organ in the body and with our typical American lifestyle it is under enormous strain.  It will blow your mind to discover just how much toxin the liver works to eliminate from the body and how critical the liver is to your quality of life and protecting against and fighting disease.  Your liver does about 500 or more different processes, many of them at the same time.  It works constantly, without rest to keep you alive and well. Toxic Relief will make you want to eat right and make you afraid not to.  You\'ll want to be a lot nicer to your liver after reading this book.  The book takes you step by step through a process of liver detoxification (2 week program) and juice fasting (which follows the liver detox - actually the 2 week program is to jump start your liver so that you will gain the most effective results from the juice fast and eliminate, safely and effectively, the most toxins from your system as well reap the most healthful benefits of the juice). Not only does Dr. Colbert tell you how to go about juice fasting, he tells you what kind of juicer you need, where to buy it and even how much to expect to spend.  He lists the important vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs and other nutrients and foods that are most beneficial to liver detox and restoring health to the GI tract (your intestines and digestive system) and he tells you how much of each to take, when to take it, and how.  He also lists and explains the foods that are harmful to your liver.  The book also includes juicing recepies for each day during the fast (morning, mid-morning, afternoon and evening).  There are six recipie veriations for six different types of drinks for each time of the day or you could apply a different drink for each day of the fast.  The recepies are fantastic and enormously simple, but it\'s also fun to totally create your own concoctions.  Dr. Colbert tells you what juices are most important, even for your particular blood type, and tells you specifically what juice should make up the bulk of each drink. Dr. Colbert spends the majority of the book discussing the health benefits and healing qualities of juice fasting and liver detox, but also explains the spiritual benefits of fasting and gives some practical tips about how to approach a spiritual fast. This was an excellent book!  Not boring in the least and gives you real information that you can put to use right away.  He\'s not trying to sell the reader on some product or multi-level marketing scheme.  This is just good information on how to jump-start your immune system, increase energy, fight disease, look and feel great!  Every person in America should read this book and follow its prescribed program.  I bought a juicer right after reading it and am on the program now!  WOW!!!  That\'s all I can say.  You\'re gonna feel amazing and you\'re gonna get a ton of those poisoness toxins cleaned out of your system!  Get this book!  You will not be disappointed, I promise!\n'

aS'\nI open this review with a very strong piece of advice: please listen to this album in its entirety.  Then come back to it within a day or two (or sooner, if you are so inclined) and give it a second listen from beginning to end.  If you do that, unless you really dislike "this kind of music", I\'m relatively certain you will be enchanted with the album permanently.  Plastic Beach is truly an amazing work.\n \n Keep the following thoughts in mind as you navigate through other reviews of Plastic Beach.  First, immediately discount any that express disillusion that this album is not the sequel to its stellar predecessor, Demon Days (2005).  Comparisons to Demon Days (and, by extension, the 2001 self-titled debut album) are useful to the extent they allow you to see how the Gorillaz sound has evolved over the course of a decade.  To truly appreciate this work fairly, however, you should judge it on the strength of its own merits.  Moreover, this review is being written the day of its United States release, and there are currently a handful of reviews that rate the album poorly.  These reviews seem to have a few things in common: they show very little regard to not only the craftsmanship and genius behind this work, but seem to be written from a jaded aspect that belies someone writing against a deadline and only taking time to listen to the album once (if they even listened that much).\n \n That said, while this album isn\'t perfection personified, it really is quite good, easily earning a 9 out of 10 rating.  Below I will grade each track individually, but first I want to address the album as a whole.  Clocking in at just under an hour, this album is a cohesive whole that takes you on a sonic journey full of unlikely sights and stops along the way (often even within the individual songs themselves).  It\'s not surprising that this album in its formative stages was originally named "Carousel" by its loving architect, musical wizard Damon Albarn.  The album is a special kind of ride.  At times the album makes you think, but not too hard, because it doesn\'t purport to take a stand on any of the issues it brings to the surface.  Other times the album makes you want to sing along, but not too loudly, because you want to be able to appreciate the artistry at work in each song.  Most importantly, the album makes you feel emotion.  Whether it be exhilaration, abandon, wonderment, or disquiet, you feel it with force.  \n \n On to the snapshots of each song in the US track-list.\n \n 1) Orchestral Intro -- 4/5\n       This track lets you know you are headed somewhere important and maybe just a little bit different.  If you listen closely, the fade-out carries a hint of distortion, which I take as an indication that the nature you are about to experience is quite unnatural.\n \n 2) Welcome to The World of The Plastic Beach -- 3/5\n       There\'s probably no truer living representation of hip-hop than Snoop Dogg, and he serves as an apropos master of ceremonies welcoming you to your destination.  Snoop has always had a unique five-star flow, and it\'s on full display on this track.  Ever since his debut album Doggystyle (1993), however, he has an uneven track-record of bringing the heat to whatever song he\'s spitting rhymes on.  The frustrating thing about Snoop is that both the listener and he are in on the fact that many times he is as lazy a lyricist as the flow of his trademark delivery, and that is indeed the case in this song, using trite expressions like "Boss Dogg" (not once, but twice), "mirror, mirror on the wall" and "crack-a-lackin".  For the record, my wife thinks that Snoop did exactly what he was supposed to do on this track: introduce, not steal the stage.  Regardless, aided by the sick horns of the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, this song helps get you in the mood to groove.\n \n 3) White Flag -- 3/5\n       A light, flighty orchestral piece by the Lebanese National Orchestra For Oriental and Arabic Music (I think I got that right...) takes you to Bollywood and some other exotic places you\'ve probably never been to as you skip across the sand of Plastic Beach for the first time.  You are suddenly greeted by a hot potato back-and-forth rap between British grime rap stars Kano and Bashy set to a dub beat.  Their wordplay forms the musical meat sandwiched between the previously mentioned beginning of the track and its conclusion, which is a synthesis of the orchestral part and the dub beat.  The final outcome is both an unlikely treat and treatise from your locale.\n \n 4) Rhinestone Eyes -- 5/5\n       This song has video single written all over it.  2D\'s vocals take center stage for the first time.  It\'s a heavily synthesized pop tune complete with catchy not-quite-a-chorus repeats of the phrase "Love Electric-tric-tric-tric-tric" that you can only imagine yourself chanting alongside Noodle.  This song also carries that signature "Gorillaz sound" of keyboards and drumbeats that can be traced back to their debut album.  This song is definitely one of the reasons I regard the album so highly.\n \n 5) Stylo -- 5/5\n       The lead single and video from the album.  "Feel Good, Inc." it is not, but this fact only adds to "Stylo"\'s charm.  An unyielding beat accentuated by an insidious, haunting repetition of the phrase "Overload", a slick verse from Mos Def, and the undeniable raw power of Bobby Womack make this song an instant classic.  You don\'t get "Stylo" at first, you just know it has a catchy beat.  After multiple listens, though, you realize the song is consummate.  It is worth mentioning that essential to the whole Gorillaz concept is the fact that their music is both an audio and visual experience.  Taken in that light, the promotional video shot for this track by co-creator Jaime Hewlett does an excellent job of immediately engaging the audience and drawing them into Plastic Beach. \n \n 6) Superfast Jellyfish -- 4/5\n       Rumored to be the second video and single from the album, this song is dripping with sinister irony.  De La Soul become the first rap artists to score a follow-up opportunity with the Gorillaz, and they do not disappoint in this twisted indictment of consumerism, cloaked in a breakfast meal jingle.  Though not as in-your-face and extreme as, say, Johnathan Swift\'s 1729 pamphlet "A Modest Proposal" the implications of this song are meant to be frightening.  Gruff Rhys also lends his vocals to the track that is both scary and scary good.  \n \n 7) Empire Ants -- 5/5\n       The beautiful, peaceful beginning of this song shows Plastic Beach at its most serene.  The guitar makes a rare appearance, and it strums blissfully along in concert with 2D\'s singing and piano accompaniment.  Then, halfway through, the song it improbably explodes into a shimmering disco-pop tune completed by the vocals of Yukumi Nagano from the Swedish group, Little Dragon.  This may very well be the album\'s best song, though "Broken" gives it a serious run for its money a few songs later.\n \n 8) Glitter Freeze -- 2/5\n       Personal preference here, but this is my least favorite song of the lot.  Mostly instrumental with a few sparse words from curmudgeon Mark E Smith, this song is an aural assault on your eardrums and mind.  Often, after this song ends, I\'m relieved, because it feels like I\'ve just been willingly violated, which might just be a microcosm for one of the tenets of the album, namely the willful violation of our own home planet.  But just as soon as you begin to contemplate that we are off to our next song.\n \n 9) Some Kind of Nature -- 3/5\n       Many are split on this Lou Reed guest effort, where his sing-song voice takes Albarn\'s piano-based beatnik ditty for a quick spin.  Some hail it as the watermark of Plastic Beach, while others decry it as its nadir.  The song comes pre-loaded with a fully realized chorus and simulated clapping that beckons singing along.  I\'m still not sure what to make of it all, I find myself in neither of the previously mentioned camps of supporters or naysayers, but I believe it is a solid addition to the album regardless.\n \n 10) On Melancholy Hill -- 5/5\n       An endearing track.  Listen closely and you\'ll hear a rhythm that lies beneath Coldplay\'s "Viva La Vida" and the song it borrowed heavily from "Foreigner Suite" by Cat Stevens.  I doubt it is intentional, and it is otherwise completely overshadowed by what is quite an uncharacteristically upbeat, almost saccharine ode from Albarn.  While this song is technically 2D from Gorillaz, it is also every bit just Damon being himself.\n \n 11) Broken -- 5/5\n       My favorite of the album.  The song evokes Clint Eastwood with its pseudo-riff on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" theme by Hugo Montenegro.  The song is beyond phenomenal, and I think this is no coincidence, another 2D solo joint that can just as easily be seen as Damon Albarn as himself.  The beat is seriously sick and haunting at the same time.  The production sounds as if lifted off a top-flight hip-hop producer\'s private instrumental songbook, but it is so much more due to Damon\'s vocals dominating the song.  I don\'t care what he is singing about in this song, I just want to listen and feel his lament.  It\'s why this album, and its creator, are one-of-a-kind.\n \n 12) Sweepstakes -- 4/5\n       Hated this song at first, due to the repetition of the beat and the rhyme.  However, keep listening: the lyrics actually change, not in their content, but in their delivery, just as the song itself transforms into something greater than the sum of its parts.  Several minutes of repetition in, you are greeted again by the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble amplified this time with a percussion section that evokes an American college football halftime band performance.  Mos Def is most definitely a winner on this track.  Hip-hop heads will prefer this track to the rest of the album\'s offerings, which speaks to the fact that there is almost something for everyone here.\n \n 13) Plastic Beach -- 3/5\n       I can\'t hear Mick Jones\' contribution to this song, but ex-Clash band-mate (and frequent Albarn-collaborator) Paul Simonon\'s strings sound pretty good on the title track.  The track is funky, a little bit eerie, and definitely keeps the mood of the album and its maybe-fictional-maybe-real setting at the center of your mind as your trek through Plastic Beach nears its end.\n \n 14) To Binge -- 5/5\n       For those not expecting Blur to ever make a guest appearance on this album -- well, don\'t worry, they didn\'t.  But this is as close as you\'ll ever get, since even the most casual Gorillaz fan will notice that 2D doesn\'t sound anything like himself on this record.  In fact, he sounds just like Albarn from Blur during the height of the 90s Britpop era.  This time, however, he is trading verses with guest singer Yukumi Nagano who appears in her second contribution to the album.  The song is like a fading sunset, with clouds developing as the song itself fades out.  If this is the final album from the Gorillaz, I think this song serves as its official good-bye.  And even though two more tracks come after this one, they feel more like encores than anything.\n \n 15) On The Cloud of Unknowing -- 4/5\n       But what encores they are!  Powerful, powerful stuff from Bobby Womack here, coupled with chilling and atmospheric instrumentation from Sinfonia ViVA, make this a contemplative song, even if the first few listens give little clue as to what you and singer are contemplating.  It can be simply described as a pretty song.\n \n 16) Pirate Jet -- 4/5\n       I have an image of an animated pogo-stick or slinky, or something bouncy like that just hopping all over this song like a little kid.  "It\'s all good news now, because we left the taps running for a hundred years."  Call it tongue-wagging sarcastic optimism at the prospect that even as foolish and wasteful we humans are, Nature will adapt to whatever is thrown at it, and persevere.  That\'s my take, at least.  And with that, the final opus in the Gorillaz trilogy (this is widely rumored to be the final album for the group) comes to a close.\n \n If you have made it to the end of this review, thank you.  I had fun sharing my rambling thoughts on what I feel is a great album.  If you have not already purchased this album, give it a try, you will be happy you did.\n'

aS"\nMy Prius has a rough dashboard and a windshield that slopes very sharply.  Thus, the suction cup mounts are not good solutions.  Fortunately, the friction mount is a great solution. It works much better than I expected.  Very stable, does not slide, and lets me adjust my Nuvi to a variety of different angles.  I can place the GPS anywhere on the dash or even on the center console. Also works great when transferred to my wife's Ford. \n \n Only downside to the device is that it has a rather large footprint, but not prohibitively large.  I like the fact that I can easily use this in both of our family vehicles depending on where we need the GPS. \n \n UPDATE:  Now that I have used this mount regularly since May, I have to say this is the best mounting solution I've found for a GPS or any other device for my car. It hasn't slid out of place once!! Given the rise in GPS units being stolen from cars, this mount allows you to easily stash your GPS Unit and mount out of sight and then put it back into position with ease.\n \n 2009 Update:  Still using this in my Prius and my wife has one too.  It's held up quite well.  It IS a bit bulky to store out of the way when not in use, but still a good solution.  I usually remove my GPS from the mount (a simple process) and then place the mount as far under the seat as it will go.  Not perfect, but the best solution I've found to date.\n"

aS"\nI found several reviews of other Yamaha keyboards that had a grand piano built in, and several of them pointed to this one as a huge value for the price.  The internal Piano sounds are very good, but you only have about 5 or 6 sounds.  I didn't buy it for the internal sounds.  I bought it because of its semi-weighted and graded keys, and the fact that it had a Midi in/out port.  Many of the current generation of entry-level Yamaha keyboards now have just a USB port for interface with a computer over a midi chipset, but lack that actual MIDI ports for connecting to other midi equipment.  This keyboard has the midi ports.\n \n Its also very lightweight and genuinely portable.  My only complaint was that the description said it shipped with a power adapter, and it did not. Most of the sites I checked said the power adapter was sold separately, so I was surprised that it was listed here on Amazon with it...but then it wasn't included.\n"

I carry it with me all the time and it's proven itself on several occassions.  \n \n If you want to fix almost anything almost anywhere, this bit set is good to have.\n"

aS'\nThe Nintendo Wii is the most inexpensive of the current generation of gaming consoles. It provides motion sensing controllers and 480p graphics. We tested the Wii before its launch day (I\'m a game reviewer), and we had our own unit in our home the morning of launch day. Here are our findings.\n \n The Wii is designed around a menu of "channels". There is of course the game-playing channel, where the Wii will play any Wii or GameCube game. Simply load the disc in and go. There is a Mii channel where you set up a profile and avatar to connect to all your game playing. The Photos channel lets you look at photos on your TV. Other channels for news, weather, and online shopping require an interent connection; the news and weather were not actually working at launch time.\n \n The system does NOT have a regular network cable port, which both the PS3 and XBox 360 have. Instead, it works with built in wireless or with a USB network adapter. I am a firm proponent of wireless - less clutter! So I am thrilled that they offer wireless automatically. With the PS3, you have to pay extra for the 60 gig unit to get this built in. The XBox 360 requires extra hardware as well.\n \n It\'s hard to generalize gameplay on any console - it really depends on what games you buy. That being said, the comes-with-it software of Sports is really quite fun and is about as basic as you can get. You swing at baseballs, lob tennis balls, bowl, box and play golf. A "fitness" mode puts you through a variety of tasks and then calculates your fitness age, sort of like how Brain Age keeps track of your mental age. If you did both every day, you could aim to be as fit mentally and physically as possible! \n \n In a world where video games = couch potato, it really is quite amazing to have a game where it natively expects you to move and be active. You don\'t lounge back and gain pounds here while playing games. Boxing can be quite strenuous, jabbing, blocking and weaving in real life. Tennis involves quick reflexes and strong arm movements. Bowling might be the most relaxed of the sports, but even there you are standing, moving, swinging. You get your heart going at least a little, and get some exercise. My boyfriend had a sore arm after playing for a number of hours, in a good way, as he would from exercising.\n \n The 480p resolution is certainly not high def 1080p like the other two systems. It\'s something you accept when you\'re paying such a low price for the console. But really, it\'s not that big a deal. I still play the old Zeldas and love them for their gameplay, even though you can\'t see the pores in Link\'s face. If they are going for the cartooney characters and environments, 480p is DVD quality and is quite good. If you really, really crave high definition super realism in your games, then the Wii might not be the best choice for you. However, if you\'re fine with playing games with a more impressionist / cartooney look to them, the 480p can show that quite nicely. For example, there aren\'t fans in the stands for baseball - there are colored blocks.\n \n Nintendo has always been known as a "Kid\'s Console" - but I really do think with the Wii that they have become a "Family Console". It\'s not just kids who will enjoy this. Seniors can have fun bowling without knowing anything "Tricky" about how to use a video game unit. It\'s very intuitive. Moms can easily play with their kids, each with their own Wii profile. Adults having parties can have fun passing the controllers around. Family groups can share slideshows on the big screen while hanging out and drinking wine. Every person who has come over - from 8 to adult - has instantly understood and enjoyed the Wii, without much explanation at all.\n \n With the price tag being so low, a gaming household that "needs" a higher end system can easily save up their money to get that XBox 360 or PS3 - and still be able to justify to get a Wii for the fun, casual gaming stuff to share with their non-gaming friends.\n \n Well recommended! Since I own all three systems, and am playing all three wirelessly, feel free to contact me if you have any further questions.\n \n ================\n \n Update: One year later, and the Wii is still going strong! It\'s really funny how many people said the Wii would bomb because it wasn\'t as good as the PS3 or 360 - and here we are a year later and the Wii is still the system that people are really wanting to get. Hospitals are getting Wiis for their patients to play with. Senior centers are getting Wiis for their residents to play games together with. I was just on a cruise ship and they had Wii tournaments going on every day! This is a fantastically fun system that we really enjoy playing with and that literally the whole family can have fun with. There are great games for kids, great games for teenagers, great games for adults. I am really very pleased with how the Wii has held up and the game set available for it.\n \n Update 2: 2 years later! Our Wii is still adored in our household, used just as much as the PS3 and XBox 360. I was just at a bar and they had two Wiis set up for people to play with, and everybody loved them. This really is an "every person\'s gaming system".\n \n I\'m running out of space here, but my nintendo.bellaonline.com site has full articles on exactly what you get in this box, and what else you should buy so you have a full system to play with.\n'

aS"\nI purchased this product for my 20 month old son to use on a 800 mile car trip. It was very helpful for giving him small snacks like cereal, and crackers while on the road. Much easier than handing him one piece at a time! The tray wiped clean very easily. There were some crumbs in the corners, but we just shook them out into the trash. It was also good for small toys and books. I like that it is made out of a soft, but durable material, which makes it safe in case of a car accident. The material feels like the padded shoulder straps of a backpack. It is lightweight, and my son didn't seem to mind it. He even fell asleep with the tray in place. This tray will go with us on every car trip in the future!\n"

aS"\nWe had the original CatGenie for over a year with 3 cats in the house and loved the lack of cat odors and ease of maintenance. The maximum 4 daily cycles did use up cartridges in about 2 weeks, and we ran out frequently. We also started having to disassemble and clean it more often as time went on,and it finally just stopped working. We got the 120 version, and what an improvement! The cat activation mode really extends cartridge life significantly, and the(4)cats got used to it quickly. I highly recommend this version to anyone with multiple cats. It's a time and money saver.\n"

aS"\nThis edition is an improvement over the theatrical release and is closer to the book.  My only disappointment related to this edition was that I opened the package to find a coupon for the ULTIMATE edition, which is to be released Decemberish.  The next (and I hope final) version will have the Black Freighter story woven into the main story as it is in the book.  If you don't want multiple versions of this film, hold off buying until the end of the year.\n \n I agree with the other reviewers who note the film's ending is an improvement over the book's.  It just makes more sense in the context of the story.  This is not a knock on Mr. Moore, of whom I am a big fan. \n \n I don't understand the folks who are so down on this film, unless it is that they just had the wrong expectations and/or didn't do their homework before watching it.  It was never meant to be another Spiderman, Superman or Hulk story.\n \n Kudos to Mr. Moore.  Kudos for the team who produced this film.\n"

aS"\nWow.  I was barely able to put this book down for a second after the first few pages got me completely hooked.  Suzanne Collins narrative here has an immediacy to it that, when combined with the very dramatic life-or-death plot, is incredibly compelling.  It's entertaining, and incredibly disturbing all at once.  If this was merely a good read, I would have given it 4 stars, but they say great art leaves you changed after you experience it...  and this book definitely did that.  Suzanne Collins has, with one amazing work, propelled herself onto my top shelf.\n \n Parents, caveat emptor!  The storyline is brutal.  Even though the writing is geared for young adults, the main characters are teenagers, there's very little physical romance, and the actual violence would probably count as PG-13 nowadays...  it's probably one of the most terrifying books I've read in a very long time!  Right up there with George R.R. Martin, if not more so.  Remember what we learned from Jaws: you don't actually need to SEE the shark in order for it to be terrifying.  Sometimes not seeing the shark is even worse.\n \n The story is basically about a teenager who is forced to compete in a 24-man-enter-1-man-leaves event.  I don't want to spoil it by saying any more, but if you liked The Running Man, you'll definitely like this.  And if you're young enough that you don't remember The Running Man, nor did you get the Thunderdome reference, then I'm just way too old.  But take an old fogey's advice and read this book.  \n \n Amazon, when can I preorder book 2???\n"

aS'\nAfter I saw Thin Red Line on opening day, I was so disappointed with the lousy directing and character acting, I decided to never again see any movie hyped and directed by an unknown director.

This is just a waste of time. Failure, big time!\n'

aS'\nI\'ll admit, I had some reservations about Red Dead Redemption.  The studio that released it (Rockstar) hadn\'t done too much to distinguish it from GTA with horses.  Within the first 2 hours, however, I was blown away.  The story starts with our hero John Marston attempting to track down his former gang leader Bill Williamson and bring him to justice.  After a short cut scene, he\'s shot and left for dead.  The game opens up after some dialogue and tutorials, leaving you to your devices in 1912\'s Texas and Mexico.  The first thing you\'ll notice is the beautiful visuals.  Everything has an incredible amount of detail and draw distance, and the character models animate wonderfully.  Watching the sunset on horseback is a truly visceral video game experience, and won\'t soon be forgotten.  Combat works in a very fun, gritty way.  You have a large variety of period weapons to deal the bad guys (or good guys).  Quests can appear by talking to certain NPCs essential to the story.  They can also appear at random, forcing you to act quickly or watch an innocent die.  What really surprised me was how well the minigames were made.  Poker could be sold as a separate game in of itself, with AI "tells" and bluffing.  Five-finger-fillet is pretty funny to watch if you make a blunder.  Horseshoes and bar fights provide some enjoyable distractions.  You can waltz over to a local movie theater and watch some very funny silent films that convey the mindset of the times.  Red Dead Redemption has the most believable open world I\'ve ever played, with every feature one would expect.  The atmosphere is simply unmatched in terms of immersion and realism.  I haven\'t even mentioned multiplayer yet.  RDR supports up to 16 players over Xbox Live or PSN for full-on gunfights and skirmishes.  Game types can range from free-for-alls to CTF-structured team based modes.  There is also a separate mode called "Free Roam" that lets you and your friends form a posse and explore the entire single player map.  You can slaughter gangs, hunt down wild game, and duke it out with other posses over an enormous map.  There\'s a fully featured ranking system that tracks your progress throughout your online exploits.  Multiplayer should keep you hooked for weeks on end as you shoot up the West.  Overall, Read Dead Redemption is an incredibly good game that can\'t be missed.  Pretty much everything is perfectly polished and consistent, and you\'ll find yourself loving the Wild West\'s final days.  Go buy it now.\n \n \n PROS\n + Awesome, deep combat\n + Breathtaking visuals\n + Addictive multiplayer\n + Strong voice acting and writing\n + Best open world in a video game to date\n \n Cons\n - Occasional animation glitches\n - Some network problems, especially in Free Roam\n - Could be a little more difficult\n'

aS"\nFirst of all, apologies to all of you who are huge fans of this series of books.  I'm sure you'll hate this review, but remember, this is just one person's opinion.\n \n I was drawn to this series due to all of the press it's been receiving lately, and also because I'm up for a good, escapist vampire novel now and then.  I actually bought the whole box set when it came out recently, but am putting my review here (instead of with the boxed set) because I didn't even get past this first book.\n \n The book did not hold my interest at all, and believe me, I tried to like it.  I've been attempting to figure out what the problem is.  It's not the setting; I was born in Louisiana, so the setting was one of the attractions of the book.  It's not the overall, view-from-30,000-feet story; that was fine.  So what was it?\n \n I'd have to say it was more structural than anything else, for lack of a better word.  I found Ms. Harris' writing to be on par with what an average ninth grader might produce.  The characters, even the main ones, were a bit on the superficial side and weren't really fully developed.  The plot details were quite boring, not engaging at all.  The love scenes were a bit cringe-worthy, reminiscent of scenes from poorly executed smut novels (i.e. just as with smut novels, these parts struck me as nothing more than a fantasy on the part of the author).\n \n Overall, the simple fact that I found the book disappointing *IS* the most disappointing part.  That is, if I hadn't had such high hopes, it wouldn't be such a let down.  The story and characters had oodles of potential.\n"

aS"\nHaving owned many pro-level cameras in the past, it was difficult for me to find a solid and versatile point-and-shoot. This camera has everything I was looking for and just a bit more. \n \n Pros:\n I am impressed with the amount of control the H55 gives me.\n Panoramic imaging built in (its nice to see the results right away rather than just eyeballing it) .\n Image quality - wow @ 14MP, the images are gorgeous.\n Color accuracy is great with good lighting.\n The camera handles quite nicely and is very easy to navigate.\n The wide angle lens is fantastic at this price. As a pro I would have spent a couple hundred on the lens alone.\n Excellent range on zoom. I was quite happily surprised.\n Battery life seems much more adequate than the W330 I previously purchased and returned. \n \n Cons:\n The flash is far from balanced and seems too hot to be used for fill. I'm new on this camera and I'm used to pro-level equipment, so I'm sure I'm expecting too much here. That, or I just don't yet have the hang of it.\n Color accuracy breaks down at lower light levels. Since I didn't have a real meter with me, I couldn't tell at which precise number breakdown begins to occur. I would guess around 4 lux is about as good as it gets. Beyond around that, it gets pretty noisy. I'll experiment with some night shooting when I have it on a tripod. But I won't get my hopes up. \n Doesn't seem to allow you to manually close the lens. Not a dealbreaker, but it would seem a fairly simple feature to offer.\n"

aS'\nAs a proud owner of a PS3, I was closely following developments of when the rumored (and highly-anticipated) PS3 Slim would come out. After shelling [...] for the PS3 80GB back in 2008, I was really excited to hear that Sony not only announced a smaller version of the PS3, but also implemented a [long-overdue] $100 price cut. I immediately went out and bought the Slim as soon as possible, and am very happy with it so far. Here are my impressions:\n  \n COMPARED TO PLAYSTATION 3 "FAT"\n A LOT SMALLER\n I heard that it was smaller, but seeing is believing! The photos don\'t do the system justice, and it\'s not really till you see and feel the difference that you are impressed with it. If you can, go into your local game store and check it out for yourself! If you\'ve previously owned a Playstation console, you already know the difference the slimmer version makes when compared to the original, bulky ones. What\'s really convenient is that the slimmer PS3 not only means your video gaming is more portable, but that you have a really convenient Blu-Ray player.\n  \n NOT A FINGERPRINT MAGNET\n I love the sleek look of my PS3 Fat, but don\'t like how it constantly needs to be cleaned. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet! The matte finish on the Slim is much easier to maintain. That being said, it doesn\'t look as shiny and cool, but I think its convenience outweighs that.\n  \n MORE STORAGE\n Storage was never an issue for me on my 80GB system, but for those who wanted more storage, you get 40GB more with this system (120GB in total). It may not seem like much, but you can hold MANY movies, pictures, and music albums with 120GB. If that\'s still not enough, you can always install a 2.5" hard drive yourself, or better yet, plug in an external hard drive in one of the USB ports. You can easily get a portable 500GB external hard drive for less than $100, or a bigger, bulkier one with around 1TB of storage for roughly the same. That being said, I think 120GB for $300 should be more than enough for most users, and is a significant improvement over the 80GB for $400 that people were paying just a few weeks ago!\n  \n STILL NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE\n This is my one major gripe with the Playstation 3. It really wouldn\'t have killed Sony to include this feature, as the original Playstation 3\'s did in fact include backwards compatibility with older Playstation 2 games. A lot of people counter by either saying (1) it doesn\'t make sense to buy a PS3 to play PS2 games, (2) the graphics on the PS3 are better anyway so why bother with older games, and (3) including backwards compatibility would cannibalize PS3 game sales. \n  \n While those arguments might have their merits, I\'m still frustrated that my massive PS2 library can\'t be played on the PS3, and was really hoping that Sony would include backwards compatibility on the Slim! I loved the fact the PS2 was backwards compatible with PS1 games, and really wish that Sony would reconsider this decision. \n  \n COMPARED TO OTHER SYSTEMS:\n PS3 vs. WII\n I think comparing the PS3 directly to the Wii is a bit like comparing apples to oranges, since they offer such different experiences. The Wii in my opinion is more family-friendly, while the PS3 is better for more graphics-intense games geared towards different gemographics. I\'m a huge fan of Nintendo, and I love their very family-oriented game offerings. I own a DS and Wii and still love Mario as much as the days back when I played the original Nintendo (NES). In addition, I think Nintendo\'s motion-sensitive controllers for the Wii are very innovative and fun to play with! Unfortunately however, for most gamers, the difference in game quality is noticeable when comparing the two systems. The PS3 has AMAZING graphics. On an HD Television, you notice such crisp details while playing the PS3. The Wii features only Standard Definition output, which noticeably weakens it when compared to the other next-gen consoles such as the PS3 and Xbox 360. \n  \n PS3 vs. XBOX 360\n Microsoft has an impressive gaming console in their Xbox 360 and there are some amazing titles exclusive to the Xbox, but in the end you get less bang for your buck when compared to the Playstation 3:\n  \n (1) Online gameplay: You can use the Playstation Network\'s online features without having to pay a subscription fee like you do for the Xbox. I was never a big online gamer but now I enjoy playing against opponents online.  \n (2) Internet connectivity: Built-in wireless internet connectivity on the PS3 is a much better bet than having to buy a wireless network adapter for the Xbox. Of course you can simply rely on a wired Ethernet connection, but this might be inconvenient depending on your set-up.\n (3) High-Def Video: The Playstation 3 doubles as a Blu-Ray player. Microsoft bet on the wrong horse when they were hoping that HD-DVD would come out the winner in the high-def format wars. If you want a Blu-Ray player/video game system combo, the PS3 is a great device.\n (4) Failure rate: The Xbox 360 has an absurdly high failure rate, with estimates ranging between 30 to 50% ([...]).  I can\'t verify the numbers, but know from my friends who own the Xbox 360 that they\'ve had a fair share of grief with their systems. \n  \n Microsoft does have a few edges, namely the upcoming Project Natal, unveiled at June\'s E3. While Natal may ultimately be one of the most amazing advances in video gaming, it unfortunately is still some time off from being implemented. That being said, the Playstation 3 is much more worth the cost than the Xbox 360 - at least for now. \n  \n FINAL THOUGHTS\n [...] system that doubles as a Blu-Ray player. Keep in mind though that the bulk of money spent on the video game system will not be in the initial down payment, but the subsequent games, extra controllers (only comes bundled with one controller), and other peripherals/accessories. [...]. Sony\'s refusal to incorporate backwards-compatibility for PS2 games on the PS3, however, might make your gaming library obsolete in a few years, so if you have the money, you\'re best off going for the PS3 Slim. You won\'t regret it.\n'

aS"\nWow this tool is great. If you want a great tool for survival this is it. It is very sturdy and strong. The knife could be a little sharper than what it comes as but it is still sharp enough to cut paper. The razor at the top of the blade is very sharp as well. I bought this tool to be stored in my vehicle, I drive many miles every day and my worse nightmare is to witness a car accident and not be able to help the people involved. This tool is a sharp edge, a serrated edge, a seat belt cutter, a very effective pry bar (its greatest feature) and the right angle at the end of the tool can easily break a window with no problem. The sheath that is comes with is absolutely exquisite, I own many knives and this is the best sheath I have for any knife. Another great benefit to this knife is the fact that the handles can be easily removed for maintenance. You can definitely see that this knife is built to last a lifetime of abuse. I think this knife would be best suited for firefighters and police officers or maybe, like myself, the average joe that needs to be able to help when called upon. Like I said before this tool would be very good for camping and outdoor use, you can chop wood or skin an animal. I think of the lack of a point as a plus because it makes for a stronger tool, there's no tip to break off! Buy it, you will show it off to everyone and they are going to want one too!\n"

aS'\nWith this his first novel, author William Golding wrote a novel that he could never surpass in greatness. Lord of the Flies is a novel about our human nature. Too often I think, people jump to quick conclusions about the book and Golding\'s stand on human nature. "His stance is too pessimistic" or "That books really gross." What these people fail to realize is that Golding tried to paint a picture of human nature as he saw it. He wasn\'t making things up, I don\'t think he was particularly angry, he wrote Lord of the Flies to expose people to the atrocities that he witnessed in World War II.  One of the largest underlying principles in Lord of the Flies is of course, human nature. William Golding gives the reader three interesting characters to analyze: Jack, Piggy, and Ralph. It\'s quite apparent as you read the novel that Golding must have read a little Sigmund Freud before writing Lord of the Flies. Let\'s start with Jack. Jack is the definite Id on the island. He wants to survive but he also wants to eat meat and have fun. Jack is clearly unable to control these urges and in turn has a pretty large influence on the other boys on the island. Piggy is the definite Superego on the island. Piggy is always referring to "well my auntie..." and always finds an excuse not to do something. Piggy has no intentions of satisfying his id, and in turn influences only Ralph and Simon. Ralph on the other hand, takes the middle road. He is clearly trying to find a way to satisfy his id, but he can\'t seem to find one. Take what he said in chapter eight for instance: "...Without the fire we can\'t be rescued. I\'d like to put on war-paint and be a savage. But we must keep the fire burning..." Ralph is definitely trying to satisfy his id, but those laws of culture still remain with him, telling him it\'s not the thing a proper English boy should do.  Another interesting connection I made while reading, was one between Jack\'s status of leader and the ideology of Thomas Hobbes. Unlike Hobbes though, Jack\'s power was used for quite the opposite affect. Hobbes believed that in order for a perfect society to exist, a higher power had to be in charge, in order to keep the other citizens in check. Jack was that higher power on the island. He was in control of everything, however, his power had quite the opposite affect of "keeping people in check." Jack used the powerful persuasion of the id to persuade others. Jack could promise meat and fun, whereas Ralph could promise labor and fruit, something the other boys definitely didn\'t want.  Lord of the Flies is also a novel filled with symbolism. Probably the most important of these symbols was the conch. The conchs represented several things, including freedom and order on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, unity between the boys. One of the most interesting aspects to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn\'t use it. This shows a lack of leadership or strength on Piggy\'s part. The conch became a tool of free speech. Those who wanted to speak at the tribal council had to hold the conch in order to be heard. However, as the story progressed, this practice diminished more and more, until the island was a place of complete chaos and anarchy. In one of the last chapters of the novel, the conch gets completely destroyed. This symbolizes two things. First, it symbolizes the end of order on the island- no more meetings, no more assemblies, none of that, the island was a place of anarchy. Secondly, this destruction symbolizes the end of Ralph\'s leadership. The boys had become slaves to Jack and his power, their conscience gave in.   Finally, about the novel itself. Golding is quite obviously a fan of Joseph Conrad. The writing style is almost identical, and the subject matter is very similar, with Golding opting to use children (young boys) instead of the men of Conrad\'s Heart of Darkness. The novel moves very quickly and it\'s rather short (202 pages in my copy.) You\'ll be immersed in the varying characters and degrees of humanity that they present. Keep in mind, that although Golding\'s view on humanity may seem very pessimistic, he\'s writing from his perspective on human nature, something that he witnessed first hand during WWII.\n'

aS"\nI bought my X11s to improve my gameplay in Modern Warfare 2 and to play at night while my family is asleep. I am so glad that I did. They have accomplished both objectives with flying colors. The sound quality is excellent. I can hear absolutely everything, even the faintest sound cues I could never hear before. Just the ability to hear footsteps, the direction that they are coming and what they are walking on makes all the difference in multiplayer. Before ordering them, I read many reviews that mention a hiss when the headset is plugged in and was a bit worried that this might be an issue. There is a hiss, but it is so negligible that it isn't even worth listing as a con. Almost all the other reviews that I've read that mention this hiss also mention that you can't even hear it during gameplay. Doesn't that pretty much disqualify it as a con? Honestly, these things could play Home On The Range until I put my MW2 disc in the drive for all I care. There has to be absolute silence in the game in order to hear the hiss. As soon as any music or in game action starts, it is gone, in no way hindering your gaming experience. I also didn't have any problem hearing this hiss while using the X11s with my iPhone for music or YouTube. The ability to control both the game and chat volumes works very well. I've played several very long MW2 multiplayer sessions with friends and I haven't had any issues with my friends hearing me or vice versa. I love that when you raise the game volume, it automatically adjusts the chat volume so that the game audio doesn't drown it out. Which is a good thing, because these bad boys are loud as hell when you crank them up. I have literally jumped in my seat during unexpected explosions. The volume and quality of the sounds make for a very immersive gaming experience.  They are also extremely comfortable. Most of the time, I can barely tell they are there, even when I've had them on hours at a time. My old headset sat right on my ears, which would make my ears very sore, very quickly. Overall, I have to give these a five out of five. For the price, they just can't be beat.\n"

aS"\nThis album is kind of an odd duck. On the whole, it's produced a lot more like the European pop-dance music (vocal trance, etc) except it has some really odd instrumentation and song structures. Interesting musically. Reminiscent of electroclash with glam elements in the choruses. Lyrics are beyond dumb and occasionally autotuner is used to mask vocal deficits, but this is typical for the genre, since it's about the beats.\n \n Oh, and boy will it get you moving. Real high energy stuff. Great for a workout or the morning drive to work. Every song is good. Nearly every track sounds like it could be a single. A very solid album.\n \n Highly recommended for dance, glam, and electro fans. Most everyone else with a moderately open mind to dance or pop should like it too.\n \n If you like this album, you should probably check out the Veronicas new album too. Another great electro/dance/pop album with rock song structures.\n"

aS'\nI have been very entertained with this book since I was a child. This book is a very interesting and good read with lots of great situations from everyday life to the extremes. \n \n This book is great for emergencies but it\'s also good for everyday reading. It contains a lot of useful information gathered from other books in the series. Not only will you read about dangerous situations, but you will also be able to read about social situations such as meeting your date\'s parents. \n \n The facts in this book seem very logical. It\'s not made up and misleading information. The author of this book/series has put a lot of research into situations mentioned in the book(s). This book and its information is not a hard to read book at all. The wording is very simple for you to be able to actually remember some of the steps for situations. Everybody from ages 6 to 150 years of age will enjoy and love this book.\n \n For $16 this book is a very good deal. If you look at the other series (there are a lot) and add up the cost for each one, they come out to a ridiculous amount. This book is a combination of all the books except the history edition. It doesn\'t have everything in it, but it has the BEST of the BEST worst case scenarios. The book is also very well designed. The yellow cover and simple titling really make it attractive. The hard cover also adds to the "wow" factor. It\'s a great book to show off to your friends/family.\n \n For $16, you get an exciting read, amazing information, attractive book, and maybe your life! I recommend this book to anyone! It makes a great gift.\n'

aS'\n"May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month," and so is Arundhati Roy\'s novel The God of Small Things. Imagine a cold piece of butter slowly melting in a frying pan, setting the scene for the cooking to come, and you  can see the way Roy\'s prose works. Words that are hot and brooding reel you  into an intricate web of family politics and social mores, evoking a  feeling similar to a written stream of consciencness.  \tRoy writes in  layers, except that the layers are both added and taken off; I was reminded  of my childhood when I would eat wafer chocolates from the bottom and the  top, leaving the middle until last, because that was the best part. Roy  kindly dispells the, often torturous, anxiety of what happens in the end  early on in the book. The reader is told what happened before it happened,  what happened after it happened, and saves what happened for last. A format  that seemingly would put off a reader becomes its most appreciated quality.  \tThis book is for everyone; murder mystery, love story, epic saga all in  one. Even if you\'re not the romantic type, the social scrutiny of Indian  customs provides for interesting reading. However, if you\'re interested in  brain candy, forget it. There is too much to absorb. Emotion and intellect  are needed in order to understand the emotion and intellect that are  related. You could take in only what is superficially presented, as the  plot alone is worthwhile, but you would be missing so much. \tRahel, a  dizygotic twin returns to the place of her childhood and subesequently a  place of unhappiness to see her brother, the other twin, after more than  twenty years of separation. Esta, the brother, has stopped talking, and  Rahel has stopped feeling. Their reunion allows for the remembrance and  grieving of their disasterous youths. They recall small things, seemingly  unimportant, yet vital to the reconstruction of their sense of inner peace.   \tThey are the same age as their mother when she died, thirty-one.  Their house is run down and the only relatives left from the monster in  their pasts are, in essence, only waiting to die. Entering their minds  through an omniscient voice, we are transported back and forth in time,  remembering small things, painting a big picture. We remember a cousin\'s  accidental death, and the death of another who served as a scapegoat. We  remember how fate can make the strangest families. We also remember Rahel  and Esta, and how they "broke the love laws. That lay down who should be  loved. And how. And how much." \tWhile the novel serves to shock the  reader from time to time, the pace is slow. Roy\'s style would be described  as somewhat verbose for the impatient, yet serves to parallel the way we  deal with emotions, hurt, and love in life.  Creating a paradox however,  this reader went back to re-absorb certain elements of beauty or truth, due  to a lack of time created by an impatience to find out what happens next. \t Although usually overly critical of fiction, I would recommend this book  for anyone who likes to read intelligent literature. It gives the reader a  chance to realize how profound those small things really are.\n'

aS"\nI'm 16 and fall into the vast catogory of Wutehring Heights readers who had to finish it for a highschool english assignment.  If I hadn't been, er, forced to read it, I never would've encountered this amazing book.  The  themes that it encompasses, love, hate, revenge, isolation, are so  masterfully blended in this book that I found it extremely powerful.  True,  it is not a romance - it is so much more.  I didn't find it confusing,  although Joseph's lines had to be read allowed several times before they  were actaully understood.  The doubling-up of names just increases the  sense of isolation within the book, something which I think is rather  important to the story.  I hardly find this book boring at all, it's  passionate and full of action, something which took me completely off  guard.  Please, give it a chance.  And even though he was a complete jerk,  my favourite character is still Heathcliff. *G*\n"

aS"\nNicholas Sparks has become famous for writing the sweet and tender love story that appeals to the romantic in all of us.  He doesn't disappoint with &quot;The Notebook&quot; as he weaves the tale of two teenagers, Noah and Allie, who meet one fateful summer and fall in love.  Since the course of true love is never smooth, it should come as no surprise that Allie's parents do not approve of her relationship with Noah.  He does not have the education, money, or social prominence they wish for their daughter. Allie and her parents move away and Noah writes to her for years, but after never receiving an answer gives up.  WWII comes, lives change, but one thing remains constant---neither Allie nor Noah can forget the other. As Noah's friend Gus tells him, first love changes your life forever and no matter what else happens in your life, the memory of it stays with you.  And so it is that fourteen years later and three weeks before her wedding, Allie finds herself driving to New Bern to find Noah for reasons she herself does not fully understand. Their reunion proves once again that they are true soulmates, but it that enough?  Can Allie forsake the &quot;perfect mate&quot; who has not only her love but also the approval of her parents?  Can she walk out on Noah for a second time?  Will Noah let her go?  The story then skips to the nursing home where an 80-year old Noah resides and spends his time reading poetry to his fellow residents.  But down the hall is a very special woman.  The reader will be overcome with emotion as this relationship unfolds and the missing pieces of Noah and Allie's story are revealed in the notebook he carries with him.  Intensely romantic and a tribute to the power of true love, &quot;The Notebook&quot; will leave you emotionally spent and thankful to be so.\n"

aS'\nI loved this book.  Loved it.  I feel that it was very much in synch with Ms. Harris\' earlier works in the series where the cohesion comes from a single mystery that runs like a river under the various plotlines (some resolved and some to be resolved).  Also unifying the whole, was the theme of \'family\' which allowed us to get to know our favorite characters on a deeper level --really nice at this late stage in the series.\n \n The character developement overall in this installment was spot on and brilliant (ie: Taking one of the series\' new characters a full, believable, 180 degrees from sympathetic to psycho). Sookie is still our beloved Sookie, her black humor and sass intact, but now with some welcome maturation and self awareness (Take that Stephanie Plum!)and an ability to actually have some empathy and concern for Eric --oh, and now she will "stake a b***h" if you mess with her or her man! Speaking of whom, it\'s still our beloved Machiavellian Eric, but now he\'s realizing that he\'s got to be more open and honest if Sookie\'s going to trust him.  \n \n There\'s a return of the likable Bill for Bill fans. (Yay old Bill! Give him a woman he can mollycoddle and talk adorably stilted to for pity\'s sake.)  And even Sam was awesome and cool --his interactions with Sookie comforting and welcome instead of the yawn fest they\'ve been lately.  It was also nice to have Jason back to being Sookie\'s big brother and comic relief rather than the absent ne\'er do well.\n \n The author was on her game with her descriptions and dialogue as well.  Some favorite quotes that come quickly to mind, "...he was not a happy camper.  Well, he could pitch his tent right alongside mine." and "That looks painful.  Would you like me to nurse it?" (Honestly, the book deserves 5 stars alone for the "chair" scene and Pam calling Sookie "monkey girl"  --too much wicked fun.)  I laughed aloud throughout the book.\n \n Finally, there were a few "True Blood" shoutouts which I really enjoyed (and I include among these, a flipping of Eric\'s Maker storyline on it\'s head --way to own it, Ms. Harris, and give us something new along with a sly nod and a wink) and some clever references to past Sookie short stories --nice rewards for the faithful fan.\n \n \n \n'

aS'\nI ordered this as a 2nd monitor to replace the 19" CRT I had been using with my sys. My primary display is an Acer AL2002W, and wanted to match it up and decided to go with this as I could not find one or one close to it. This monitor is pretty much a internet monitor for use while working.\n \n Pros: Great looking display. Text is tight and crips, blacks looks clean as do whites.\n \n Cons: Thought that the info said this was a 1680*1050 display but that was a reviewer comment, not Amazon. True aspect 16:9@1600*900 60Hz\n \n Other: For a good 2nd display, or even a Primay this is a good deal. Would have like a height adjustment, but as the AL2002W does not have this, was not expecting this one to either. For $120 I can\'t say anything bad about it other than what I noted under cons.\n'

aS'\nThis was a really good book. It is written in plain language and will make you think of someone you have known. It is quick read that keeps your attention till the very end. The sad thing is, it is a book about real people. Thank God there are only four of them per hundred, put they can leave a path of destruction in their wake. Being aware of who you share this world with is very important and knowing how to deal with the ones who don\'t seem "quite right" is a lesson well worth learning.\n'

I was looking for a simple external hard drive without any backup software included, I am smart enough to do manual incremental backups with file tree structure intact (I use GOODSYNC to backup, its very simple and easy to use and free).\n \n      I have looked at many many external HDDs and narrowed down to two models "Samsung Story 1TB - very good one too" and this one (I wanted it to be cheap too - got this for $85 on [...]). I did not go with other WD models because of their annoying Backup Software.\n \n      Coming to the WD Elements 1TB: Its much smaller than I expected. It is dead silent, I had to touch it to convince myself that it was running, when I first turned it on. Its not too heavy either. The indicator light is placed at the rear, which is a very good thing (I find these LED\'s annoying, especially at night).\n \n      After I did the first setup, I copied 383GB of data (931GB was total space). It took about 4hr 47min, speed varied between 20MBps to 37MBps. This is pretty good speed for USB 2.0.

aS"\nI've owned just about every top rated vacuum that has been made. I was never satisfied, mostly because they where too heavy to handle, or the animal hair was blown about, rather than sucked up. I do have a canister vacuum that I have had for years, but I wanted a satisfactory upright that was light and easy to handle. I have a cat and a dog, and there is lots of shedding hair, all the time. Our house is mostly hard floors, stairs, and one large rug in the living room. When I saw the DC25 Animal, I decided to spend the money hoping that this vacuum would do the job. It has lived up to my wildest dreams, it is wonderfully easy to handle, so easy to maneuver, the 16 lbs make such a difference compared to those very heavy machines I had before, I had no problem carrying it upstairs. I love that with this vacuum I don't need to select different heights, it goes from floor to carpet to floor. I was even able to clean the dogs bed without the wand attachment. Speaking of the wand/handle attachment you simply flip open the top cap, pull up on the wand, and it disconnects from the vacuum and suction diverts to the wand. It took a little getting use to, the hose is a little stiff and took a while before I was comfortable cleaning the stairs. Most important, THIS VACUUM SUCKS, but in a good way!! \n Assembly was fairly easy, suppose to be 3 snaps with no tools. But I had a heck of a time getting it out of the box, and being not mechanically inclined I would have liked better instructions. \n I have never reviewed a product before, but this vacuum cleaner has me so excited that I had to share it with someone. I really love this machine!\n"

aS'\nIf I had to list Sarah Palin\'s best qualities, I would say: "integrity, intellect, patriotism, energy, and a good sense of humor." She is a breath of fresh air in our national politics, an honest person who loves this country passionately and truly serves the people rather than special interest groups. \n \n The book has answered many of the questions that I had about the 2008 presidential campaign, the supposedly weak interviews that Sarah Palin gave to some reporters, about her post-election fight with frivolous ethics complaints and her retirements from the Governor of Alaska office. Most importantly, Going Rogue, has given me confidence that we have a brilliant candidate for president in 2012. \n \n Going Rogue is full of fun facts about the Palin family, Alaska politics, and the 2008 campaign. If you are a conservative, you\'ll love this book. If you are an "independent", then you should definitely read Going Rogue to form your own opinion of Sarah Palin. If you are a liberal who hates her guts and doesn\'t know why, then what are you even doing reading my five-star review?!\n'

aS'\nTo properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power. All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.\n \n I\'ll begin by saying that I\'ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean. I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well.\n \n ProGlide vs. Hydro 5\n Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.\n \n What\'s included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.\n \n Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette\'s as a travel holder with no problem.\n \n Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. The Gillette assumes you will like it.\n \n The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro\'s trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.\n \n Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as "suspension" for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette...less waste.\n \n On initial "hefting" the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.\n \n The Shave Test\n All of the above are secondary to the "Yes, But How Does It Shave" test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using Proraso Shaving Cream  and a badger bristle brush.\n \n Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)\n The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.\n \n The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small "razor burn" marks on my neck. To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.\n \n Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.\n \n The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face "dried" she still said the Gillette side was smoother.\n \n Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)\n The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.\n \n ProGlide vs Quattro\n Shave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).\n \n The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.\n \n In both tests, the ProGlide performed as before, with no pulling or burning. The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.\n \n As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.\n \n So what\'s not to like? The price of the cartridges. Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette. Power ProGlide carts are about $4.00 apiece, where Quattro Power carts are about $2.50 each.\n \n While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn\'t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.\n \n Overall, though, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars. As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor. If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.\n'

aS'\nI couldn\'t be happier with this purchase. I\'ve always been fairly inactive and now that I\'m in my mid-40s, it\'s been starting to cause an overall lack of stamina and back pain and exhaustion from walking short distances (and I\'m not even overweight). But after just 2 weeks of Wii Fit Plus (usually 30 -45 minutes per day), I\'m really noticing a difference. I\'m thrilled!\n \n You can work up a sweat without even noticing because you\'re having so much fun. The Island Cycling is my favorite (love the Island View Course). It definitely gets your blood pumping. Some of my other favorites include Rhythm Kung Fu, Advanced Step, Hula Hoop, Obstacle Course, Rhythm Parade, Bull\'s Eye, Jogging and Boxing. There are so many choices that it\'s hard to imagine anyone not finding something that\'s fun for them or that suits their needs and goals (unless they\'re already in great shape).\n \n Some of the activities can be a bit challenging to get the hang of (and it seems that different people have trouble with different things). I\'m disastrous at skateboarding, but I\'m a "calorie torcher" at obstacle course. My boyfriend\'s 12-year-old son got quickly frustrated with the obstacle course, but I bet he\'d be a natural at skateboarding. You just have to find what works for you. Fortunately there are plenty of choices!\n \n Another fun feature is that you feel like you\'re working out with your friends and family. As your family members add themselves to the program (and you can also add your pets), they are featured throughout the game. Your regular Wii friends are featured too, but not as prominently. They cheer you on at the finish line, demonstrate the moves, toss you your hula hoops, march in your band, etc., and your pet can run along side you as you cycle. It can be an added little boost to your workout. Wii Fit Plus also keeps track of your best times/scores, so it\'s fun to be able to challenge your previous records. It always feel great when you beat your previous best.\n \n The yoga is good if you like a more calm, relaxed type of workout. Personally I have a hard time staying away from the more active games, but I\'m glad it\'s there when I want to work on strength.\n \n'

aS'\nNever mind that Clash of the Titans play fast and loose with the mythological story of Perseus. Never mind that Medusa wasn\'t a Titan. Never mind that the Kraken is from Scandinavian mythology, and that casting Lawrence Olivier as Zeus in the 1981 version was sort of typecasting.\n \n The new Clash of the Titans is a darker, grittier more realistic Bronze age world than the 1981 version, but the story hasn`t changed all that much. The citizens of Argos have become disenchanted with the rule of the Gods. The Gods have caused too much chaos and ruin to their lives so they\'ve decided to take their destinies into their own hands, and destroy the temples and statues of the Gods. In doing so, Perseus\'(Sam Worthington) family is killed by a falling statue of Zeus. When Zeus (Liam Neeson) learns of the desecration urged on by Hades (Ralph Fiennes), he decides to destroy the city in four days or they can offer the sacrifice of the King of Argos\' daughter Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). In a visit to the throne room of Argos, Hades lets it slip that Perseus is a son of Zeus, a demi-god. Being told of his near divinity, Perseus and a group of soldiers go off on their quest to save the city.\n \n The special effects are great! The monsters look real and the characters realistically interact with them. In 3D the water roiling off the undulating tentacles of the Kraken must look really cool! The problem is they shortchanged the story in favor of the special effects. The story only follows the barest of outlines of the myth. Same with the 1981 version, although it\'s a little more faithful to the myth. The most glaring lapse is there really isn\'t any reason for Perseus to save Argos. In the myth his reason to save the city is for the love of Andromeda. In this version he\'s a stranger to Argos and doesn\'t fall in love with Andromeda. She\'s barely a consideration until she\'s needed to be sacrificed to the Kraken. The only reason he seems to take up the quest is because he\'s the nearest handy demi-god that can help out. Worthington\'s Perseus doesn\'t seem very heroic, there doesn\'t seem to be any emotional investment in Perseus in either the quest or the surrounding characters. Most of the time he has a stoically sullen, put upon attitude, and this keeps the audience at arms length from the character. He doesn`t seem to embrace the heroic at all. Yes, he kills the monsters, but the tasks he must accomplish like tricking the Stygian witches and figuring out how to survive the encounter with Medusa, he seems to accomplish almost by accident. It seems that Perseus isn\'t meant to be heroic. he repeatedly says he wants "to do this (the quest) as man, not a God," and he keeps refusing the gifts of the Gods. The message in the myth is for mortals to find the divine, to find the god, the hero within themselves, Perseus\' refusal of the gifts of the Gods, is the refusal to find the hero within himself.\n \n The 1981 version, although a bit campy in it\'s delivery tells the hero\'s story better. The 2010  version delivers better on the special effects. If such a thing were possible as to merge the strengths of both, you would have a better movie.\n \n DVD/Bonus Features: When Clash of The Titans becomes available on DVD, I\'ll edit the review to reflect what\'s included in that package.\n'

aS"\nWhen reading reviews, particularly on Amazon, I've noticed a lot of complaints about how the Patterson books are written.  As a reader, what I care about is the end result.  I want a good story.  Sometimes, Patterson's formula works and sometimes it doesn't.  I enjoy The Women's Murder Club series and the Alex Cross series (though I must admit, I'm behind on both series.)   So far I've enjoyed the books written with (or some might say by) Maxine Paetro.\n \n I found Private to be a good story.  At first I was a little distracted by the different mysteries going on at the same time.  However, once it occurred to me that a detective agency the size of Private would be involved with multiple cases, I found that I rather liked the bouncing between the cases.  Private is a quick read.  I found it to be a good example of what I think goes on in a large detective agency.  I could be wrong, but who cares. I enjoyed the book and there are really only two reasons for reading a book - entertainment and/or information.  Will this book win any awards? Probably not.  Do I feel as though I wasted my time reading it? No.  If you want a quick read, this is the book for you.  If you care more about how the book is written than the end result, then find another book and another author.\n"

Once you get used to using iTunes (yeah, you have to), it is quite easy to set up your music any which way you want. It is quite simple to build playlists by album, genre, or artists.

aS'\nINTRODUCTION\n Mass Effect, by Electronic Arts (EA), sets the benchmark for third person role playing actions games. It is as close to a DVD movie as a video game can get, because, unlike most first person games, players can see and hear the player character as well as the non-player characters (NPCs).  This movie-like quality greatly enhances the compelling story, which is the hallmark of the Mass Effect Trilogy. \n \n THE PLOT\n **Spoiler Alert**\n This second episode of the Mass Effect Trilogy begins with the death (yes, DEATH) of Commander Shepard, in a fiery ambush of the Normandy, two years after he/she defeated the traitorous Saren Arterius in the battle of the Citadel.  But, thank the goddess, he/she is later resurrected in Project Lazarus by the Illusive Man, leader of Cerberus, a shadowy and ruthless "human supremacist" organization, for the sole purpose of sending the legendary commander to investigate a new cataclysmic event in the Galaxy: entire human colonies have been vanishing without a trace, leaving behind empty buildings. To confront the threat, Shepard travels across the Galaxy to recruit up to a dozen of the most dangerous characters to his/her elite team, at locations including Illium, an asari colony, and Omega, a lawless mining station built on a hollowed out asteroid in the Terminus Systems, for a mission from which every member of the team, including Commander Shepard, may never return.\n **End of  Possible Spoilers**\n \n THE CHARACTERS \n Players who had completed Mass Effect 1 (ME1) can import a Save Game from the list of Character Saves  into Mass Effect 2 (ME2).  During the file transfer, they have the option of changing the class of Commander Shepard, for example, from adept to vanguard, as well as his/her physical characteristics. This is possible in the storyline on account of Project Lazarus--a very clever way of putting Shepard on reset. If  Shepard was imported at a high level in ME1, players will be awarded with bonus squad points and research metals at the start.  (See my comment below.) All the NPCs who were alive at the end of the ME1 are transferred. Furthermore, the story in ME2 unfolds in accordance with the decisions made by the players in ME1, for example, whether Shepard set the Rachni queen free in Noveria, whether he/she resolved the conflict with Wrex on Virmire peacefully, or whether he/she called in the human fleet to save the Council in the battle of the Citadel. For those who never play ME1, ME2 can be played stand-alone with new characters and certain pre-set assumptions on events in ME1. New characters in ME2 include Thane, a drell master assassin, Legion, a free-thinking geth, who is stalking Commander Shepard, and Subject Zero, a female human biotic gang and cult member, with head-to-toe tattoos. Other than the geth and the Reapers, new enemies emerge in ME2. They include the Collectors, a winged insect-like species who are suspected to be working for the Reapers, and Scions, which are grotesque experiments of the Reaper, as well as monstrous beings created by the Reapers out of other species they abducted. \n \n THE GAME/COMBAT SYSTEM\n The Artificial Intelligence (AI) and combat system have been vastly improved in ME2.  Gone are those annoying texture pop-ups in ME1.  So are those long elevator rides--they are replaced with loading screens.  Battle scenes are more realistic: enemies are thrown against walls, limbs are blown off, and wounded fighters continue to fight by crawling on the ground.  Players can hit the enemies where they place the reticles, like in a shooter.  (This is not so in ME1, where hits are calculated based on the number of skill points assigned by the players to the characters.)  Players can now issue attack orders to Shepard\'s squad mates by using the directional-pad of the controller (of the Xbox 360), and manually prompt Commander Shepard to duck behind covers.  The limitless ammo is no more in ME2.  It is replaced with removable "thermal clips".  When a clip is spent, it must be ejected and replaced with a new one. Players are therefore advised to take note of the amount of thermo clips available during battles.  Instead of only four weapon types as in ME1, there are nineteen in ME2. One of my gripes with ME1 was the lack of heavy hand-held weapons.  In ME2, they are available to the soldier class player character (as well as Commander Shepard of all classes).  These heavy weapons knock down multiple enemies in one gigantic blast.  A sentinel class player character now dons an ablation tactical armor, which makes him/her very tough to kill.  An engineer class player character can launch a drone to aid him/her in battle.  An adept class player character can spawn micro-singularities around the enemies, annihilating them en masse. Tactical cloak, which renders a combatant invisible briefly, is available to an infiltrator class player character.  A vanguard class player character can dash around the battlefield with a new biotic power--the "biotic charge", which propels him/her forward at tremendous speed and force, to attack or evade the enemies.  There is no longer any class restriction in armor.  Medi-gel, used in the ME1 to regenerate health, is replaced with auto-regeneration, although the players still need it to cast the Unity reviving power.  (Note: auto-regeneration is also available in ME1, but only as an upgrade to the armors.)\n \n THE DIALOGUE\n The dialogue wheel in ME1 is the most innovative dialogue system in all the games I have ever played.  When used probably, it delivers a continuous and seamless dialogue, and hence the movie-like quality of the game.  In ME2, the dialogue wheel is further improved.  A new "interrupt" system is introduced. When prompted by the players with the left or right trigger of the controller (of the Xbox 360), Commander Shepard can interrupt the dialogue with "heroic" or "hostile" action to get the answer he/she wants.  Furthermore, instead of the previous static camera position in ME1, the camera moves around during conversations in ME2, adding further cinematic effect to the game.\n \n THE CHOICES\n Like in ME1, choices made by the players influence the outcome of the game in ME2.  For example, in ME1, on the planet Virmire, Commander Shepard (and hence the players), was called upon to decide which of the two squad mates he/she would rescue; the one left behind was consumed in a subsequent nuclear blast.  In the same manner, decisions of the players in ME2 throughout the game may eventually lead to the annihilation of the entire ground team in the final mission, including Commander Shepard, or the survival of every team member, or something in between. Players with a "dead" Shepard will not be able to import him/her into ME3. The same thing is true with a "dead" teammate.  They can play ME3 with a generic Shepard, but not "their" Shepard.   Furthermore, with Shepard killed, players can\'t return to the game world after the final mission and continue to play, for example, to complete a side quest, or to explore a new locale.  They will have to start a new game or reload with a previous save-file and replay part of the game for a different outcome.  This gives incentive to players to make sound decisions throughout the game, before heading into the final mission.\n \n THE CERBERUS NETWORK\n The Cerberus Network is a cleverly designed in-game portal through which players can access "Downloadable Contents (DLCs)" from EA.    Players activate this network with a one-time access code, which is included in every new game purchase.  Game renters and used game buyers will have to pay for the code.  This arrangement is apparently a ploy by EA to combat the rental and used game market, which has been undermining retail sales of new games.  Players who access the network will receive the first DLC pack on January 26, 2010, the date on which the game is released in North America.  This first DLC introduces Zaeed, a rough and tumble mercenary who will join Shepard\'s elite team.  A future DLC will introduce the Hammerhead, a hover tank to replace the much-maligned Mako in ME1.  (Note: There is no driveable vehicle in the core game.) In addition, new missions and in-game items will be released to gamers by EA through this network.\n \n CONCLUSION\n ME2 comes with 2 discs.  Players have to swap discs (twice per game) at some points. There are 90 voice actors playing 546 characters with over 30,000 lines of dialogue. New voice actors in ME2 include D.C. Douglas, Martin Sheen and Adam Baldwin.  In conclusion, ME2 is a role-playing game with the look and feel of a shooter.  It is a must-have game of the year.\n \n'

aS"\nThis sharply portrayed and picturesque film is no less than a stunning masterpiece!  Finely capturing the gusting momentum of a kingdom and its contending rule, all the while bootying the intricacies of family passion &amp; strife, this movie grasps all by masterfully portraying it within the frame of a Christmas holiday spent at the beauteous castle of Chinon. The year is 1183, and Henry II, insatiate King of the British Empire summons forth his family:  his wife - Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their surviving sons Richard, Geoffery, and John.  They meet at Chinon - and like every gathering of this family must always have been, this meeting is momentous ~ James Goldman wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar he won for this screenplay -- for, not only is it in tune to every orchestral note of this history, but it is also precise as a dagger in its eloquence ~~ I've rarely heard a more masterful script portrayed on film! Such a prodigious screenplay must needs have a brilliant cast and musical score to give it flesh and blood -- and herein you'll find it most heartily delivered!  Katharine Hepburn is absolutely stellar in her portrayal of perhaps one of the most fascinating women in history:  the much-acknowledged &quot;Queen of Love&quot; throughout Europe before she became Queen of France, fighting in the Crusades alongside her husband Louis VII of France - and then Queen of England, wife of Henry II, who had imprisoned her for many years for joining her sons in plots against him.  Henry would free her at times for such holiday family gatherings as this. Hepburn's scenes with Peter O'Toole, as Henry, are pure electrically-charged art!  As King and Queen, parents to the three aspired heirs to the throne, they lay blame and conspire against each other, and their sons will stop at nothing to acquire what they each feel that they deserve:  succession to the throne.  To add to this tangled web of deceit are the young King Phillip of France and his sister, Alice, who had been raised in the household of King Henry, betrothed to Richard since her infancy.  While Eleanor and her sons each plot with the French King, Henry openly exhibits his ongoing love affair with Alice~~ The chemistry of this well-casted drama is flawless - every line spoken a masterpiece of wit and daring.  This movie is a rare find, indeed!\n"

aS'\nFor any American citizen who is currently in resignation or despair over the abundant examples of unethical, immoral and abusive leaders who breed cynicism and apathy,  The Audacity of Hope is a breath of much needed oxygen. Senator Obama may be considered "soft" by the media who enjoy taking down anyone who exhibits complexity of mind, paradoxical thinking and humanistic values, yet his writing inspires one to stop wallowing in helplessness and take an active role in our imperfect democracy.  When Obama first spoke at the Democratic convention, Ann Deavere Smith wrote an op ed piece the next day saying that politics would never be the same because finally a leader spoke with a "unifying fusion" beyond partisanship, stereotypes and blame mongering.  The senator\'s writing demonstrates that reflective, thoughtful consideration of apparent opposites is a leadership attribute needed urgently -- Obama speaks of the need to redefine power from its corrupt, controlling misuse as currently witnessed daily to an inclusive power that practices empathy, tolerance, and a reclaiming of core democratic values.  Obama leaves the reader with a call to face our critical global issues by polishing the lens of our own perceptions rather than projecting and perpetuating fear and hatred.  Whether he will be able to pass great legislation or run for president,  this book provides inspiration to any leader who wants to demonstrate a capacity to connect with the hearts, minds and souls of generations seeking to be inspired and uplifted.  He embodies the true sense of enlightened -"awake" not perfect--able to use his intelligence for the greater good while demonstrating the humility of one who knows his own shadows.  A highly recommended read for all would be leaders.\n'

aS"\nLucy began as her father's experiment.  He raised her in the jungle while giving her a strong British education.  She was also raised by her mother who gave her an introduction to life as a bonobo.  The rest of the story is about what happens after her parents are killed and she is rescued and taken to the U.S. by Jenny.  \n \n First of all you must suspend reality to enjoy this book.  Most people seem willing to do that, with the popularity of vampire stories and Harry Potter.  \n \n Clearly I loved this book.  It is a good story, well written and just plain fun.  From the beginning I knew everything was not going to turn out okay so I prepared myself for tragedy but it came in a different way than I expected.  The way Jenny learns to love Lucy and becomes a mother to her is lovely to read.  Lucy's friendship with Amanda gives me hope that there are good people out there who really care about something other than themselves.  The same can be said for the Randalls who rescue the damsels in distress more than once.  \n \n I liked the sense of place wherever the story takes us.  I so enjoyed seeing the world through Lucy's eyes as she tries to become an American teenager.  \n \n This book should be popular with teens and adults alike.  It is light reading and goes fast.  I was sorry when it was over, as I wanted to know much more.  I hope it gets made into a movie.  I am so sick of vampire movies, I think this would be far more heartfelt.\n"

aS'\nI\'ve had my Kindle 2 since 2/24 and I loved it at first.\n \n Today is the first day when we have had bright sunshine, so I took the Kindle out in the sun and was dismayed to see that the text (particularly near the center of the screen) faded within seconds. Alt-G refresh of the screen restored the text temporarily but further sun exposure resulted in screen fading.  This is not a problem with the Kindle 1.\n \n Ever since I got the Kindle 2, its text has been lighter than my K1, but not so much that I couldn\'t tolerate it The fading in sunlight makes the text virtually unreadable.\n \n I contacted customer support (and mind you I have the extended warranty that allegedly give you advance replacement) and was told that A REPLACEMENT WOULD NOT FIX EITHER OF THE PROBLEMS and that what I should do if I were dissatisfied is simply return the Kindle 2 and all the accessories I ordered for it.\n \n Needless to say, I am a very unhappy camper. If replacing my current K2 will not fix the problem, then that means that \n \n a) they have not identified the source of the problem and \n b) that any K2 currently purchased will have a similarly defective screen.\n \n My advice: STAY AWAY FROM THE KINDLE 2 at least until Amazon acknowledges there is a problem and provides a fix. For me, I plan to stay away from the Kindle 2 forever. \n \n Thank heavens I didn\'t sell my Kindle 1!!\n \n ADDENDUM:  Following the events above, I sent feedback to Amazon about how dissatisfied I was with Customer Support.  The next day I did get a call back from someone else in Kindle support who agreed to send a replacement Kindle 2 out ASAP.  It should arrive Tuesday and I will post followup once I have a chance to check it out in bright sun.  FWIW, however, I have decided to hang onto my K1 just in case.\n \n ADDENDUM 2:  After two replacements, I finally got a K2 that does reasonably well in terms of the darkness of the text and one on which the text does not fade in the sun.  I say "reasonably well" because the text is still noticeably lighter than the text on my K1.  \n \n Despite the lighter text, I prefer the K2 for its thinness and its improved navigation and I use if far more than my K1.\n'

aS'\nAnd much of that 30 minutes was spent clearing out the old system.\n \n I purchased this to replace our old home theater system.  Our previous model, with its multiple speakers and tangle of wires, was a "true" 5.1 surround sound.  I have never been crazy about stringing up speaker wire, and the setup of our living room meant that it was bound to look unsightly.  I wanted this sound system to do 2 things: look nice and produce good sound, and it has delivered on both very well.\n \n The look is sleek.  The CD tray sits behind the front panel, which slides aside when opening (that got an "oohhh" from the kids).  The connecting wires were minimal.  The system draws its power from the sub-woofer, requiring a single outlet.  The weight of the main bar is probably less than 20 pounds, with the majority of the weight of the whole system in the sub-woofer, which rests of the floor "at least 3 feet" from the bar.  The bar rests easily on top of an entertainment center, but should not pose much problem to mount on a wall below a wall-mounted flat panel TV.  It accommodates HDTV and non-HDTV, can synch with the TV cable sound, has an MP3 jack, and has AM/FM radio receivers.\n \n As for the sound, I\'d rate it quite good for the money.  The set-up includes a brief series of questions regarding the room layout relative to the sound bar.  I assume this calibrates it for a "sweet spot" where the sound most closely recreates a surround effect.  I\'m not an audiophile, but I\'d call it a "surround lite".  It gives the sound an impression of depth that is pleasing, and the bass is deep enough to make the THX test pattern enjoyable (my personal test of "good enough").  If you are an audio purist, this is probably not the system for you, but it was a real crowd-pleaser at our house for family movie night.  \n \n So, for an easy, eye pleasing setup and very good sound in an affordable package, I strongly recommend the Phillips AmbiSound system.\n \n'

aS"\nThis could be one of the most important books you ever read.  The Secret Life of Bill Clinton is essential to understanding the serious corruption that has infested our government under Bill Clinton.  Most significantly,  Ambrose Evans-Pritchard's exposure of the existence and workings of the  murderous Arkansas mafia from which Bill Clinton hatched is something every  American should understand - particularly that Clinton brought elements of  it with him right into the White House.  Drug-trafficker Dan Lasater's  chief lieutenant Patsy Thomasson, for example, is Clinton's Director of the  White House Office of Administration.  In no other book are the ugly facts  and sinister associations laid with such stark clarity. Evans-Pritchard  writes with a clear and graceful style, laced with doses of dry English  wit.  Reviewing the fishy crime scene evidence relating to the gun found in  Vincent Foster's hand, for example, he observes: &quot;The revolver...had  not found its final resting place.  The crime scene photos show it hopping  about in a most animated way in Foster's hand.&quot;    As a result of  Evans-Pritchard being one of the small handful of journalists who actually  investigated the death of Vincent Foster and certain other Clinton-related  matters, he developed contacts and relationships with key witnesses and  others that provide his his book with devestating factual revelations that  cannot be found elsewhere. For example, the first person known to have  seen Vincent Foster's body in Fort Marcy Park, officially known as the  &quot;Confidential Witness&quot; is absolutely certain that at the time he  saw the body there was no gun.  He tells Evans-Pritchard:  &quot;The whole  thing stinks, he clearly didn't shoot himself there.  You can't shoot  yourself without a gun.  The man had no gun.  End of story.&quot; Another  example:  Jerry Parks was a Little Rock private investigator with  long-standing ties to Vincent Foster, as well as having been head of  security for the 1992 Clinton-Gore headquarters in Little Rock.  He had a  file on Clinton extra-marital affairs that Foster had hired him to compile  several years earlier.  He was murdered gangland-style two months after the  Foster death and the files were stolen.  Evans-Pritchard, over a  several-year period, was able to get Parks' widow and son to open up to him  and provide extraordinary revelations tying his murder to the White  House. Evans-Pritchard, an Englishman, has an obvious affection for this  country and an admiration for the finer qualities of the American  character. His protagonists are the ordinary people who fight the abuses of  power and corruption from their little corner.  &quot;It makes me feel  almost proud to witness such defiance,&quot; he says.  I was moved by his  seeing the virtue in our country and its people while in the midst of  exposing the  putrid evil and corruption that few seem to realize even  exists. I wonder what motivated the man, a Brit on temporary assignment  in the U.S., to perform the tremendous service to this country that I  believe he has.  I don't know, but I suspect it is a highly developed sense  of justice and a properly aroused moral indignation.  He came to the U.S.  at the end of 1992 as an admirer of Bill and Hillary Clinton, but over time  came to realize they were very different from their packaging.  He explains  &quot;Sending people to prison on false charges - or trying to do so - is  his [Clinton's] specialty, which is the chief reason I have come to revile  the man.&quot;  Of course, if you only get your information from the  mainstream media, you wouldn't have any idea of what he is talking about -  which is all the more reason to read this book. Evans-Pritchard wrote a  farewell article when he left America to return to England, the subtitle of  which was &quot;Rouse and Guard Your Liberties.&quot;  The warning is apt,  but you will have to read the book to understand why.\n"

aS'\nGamers who buy games developed or published by Atlus know that Atlus games tend to be somewhat different from other developers\' offerings. After several hours of play, I think it\'s fair to say that "Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3" continues this trend.\n \n The gameplay is fairly realistic, given that P3 is a Japanese RPG. In battle, they may stumble when attacking and leave themselves vulnerable to the enemies\' attacks. If you try to push them too hard, they will get tired, which will affect their performance. Ignore their fatigue, and they will get sick, which further hampers them. This principle applies to the main character, whom the player directly controls. Try to do everything, and you won\'t be able to do anything particularly well.\n \n Since part of the game involves the character\'s day-to-day life as a high school student, one cannot expect major plot turns every day. However, the choices the player makes in school do have an effect on the player\'s options as a Persona user. The more connections the player forges with other students, the more power he will bring to bear as a Persona user, so expect consequences if you decide to play as a loner.\n \n Some players may find some of the imagery in this game disturbing, or even offensive. The characters summon their Personae by using a gun-like device called an Evoker. Unlike another reviewer, I do not think that they are mimicking suicide. Instead, given that in-game dialogue suggests that one can summon a Persona without an Evoker, I think that the Evoker is used to break down a character\'s inner barriers so that his Persona can manifest. While I understand why the summoning animations may be offensive to some, I do think that Atlus did it this way for a legitimate reason. However, parents thinking of getting this game for their teenage children should be aware that this game contains imagery that may be inappropriate.\n \n As for the title of this review, I think this might be a thinking man\'s RPG because of the themes I\'ve encountered thus far. I haven\'t completed the game yet, so I can\'t say I\'ve seen everything it has to offer. However, given the introductory movie that plays when you load the game, I think that Persona 3 will give an attentive player a few things to think about. For example, the player is asked to sign a contract at the beginning of the game. The terms seem simple enough, but when is responsibility ever simple?\n \n As for technical details; the graphics are somewhat minimalist, but very stylish. I think that the character and Persona portraits were well done, but I don\'t think that Kazuma Kaneko (who handled character design for the other SMT games on the PS2) was involved. Shoji Meguro, however, handled the soundtrack. I suspect that some of the hip-hop influenced tracks may begin to grate on me after further play, but I am a long-haired metalhead. Your mileage may vary. You may also dislike the voice acting, but the Config menu includes an option to turn off voiced dialogue for players who just want text.\n \n I heartily recommend SMT: Persona 3, and think it\'s worth the fifty bucks I paid for it. Buy it instead of renting it, and you\'ll get a nice little art book and soundtrack disc in the package.\n'

aS"\nNew Moon starts out wonderfully - Edward's family throws Bella a birthday party, but when she has an accident and starts bleeding, the whole vampire household flips out. Consequently, Edward is filled with guilt and decides that she needs to lead a normal life without being endangered by their presence every day, and so they all pack up and leave. I nearly choked when I saw that time passes without him.\n \n But, try as she might, Bella is empty without him. She realizes that when she is in danger, she can hear his voice in her head (usually yelling), and so she begins to pursue dangerous hobbies just to hear his voice again. One of these hobbies brings her into close friendship with Jacob Black, the Quileute Indian boy who tipped her off to Edward's identity in the first book, and he seems to temporarily appease her pain at Edward's absence. But Jacob has his own secrets, and Bella is again endangered when a vampire returns to Forks for revenge.\n \n I must admit, most of the reason this book kept me up late reading was in hopes of word from Edward. Jacob and his friends were fun, and it *was* exciting to see another facet of the books' mythology, but almost the whole time Bella was with Jake, I was adamantly pining for Edward. When he does return, I was not disappointed, and Jake's involvement also sets up the potential for a powerful love triangle.\n \n It wasn't quite as solid as the first book, but I sense that New Moon is an important transition. Many questions were brought up, like whether vampires have souls, and just how far must Bella and Edward go to stay together? She wants to become one of them, and Edward insists that she remain human. Now that we've caught wind of it, what exactly is agreed in the treaty the vampires have with the Quileutes? And what will Bella do now that her boyfriend and her best friend are mortal enemies? All of this feels like necessary groundwork in order to address these issues in the next book. I enjoyed New Moon immensely, despite Edward's absence for most of it, and I'm eager for the next installment; I can't wait to see how Meyer resolves some of these issues, and what ride we will experience in the next book.\n"

It was amazing to watch him over the next year change the way he played with the toy. Initially he just played with the blocks, then threw them in the bucket, dumped them out again. He would also carry the bucket with blocks around by the handle. Later he was able to put in the round one, then another and within a short time all of them. He still likes playing with it. It was apparent that he had a sense of achievement after each new "accomplishment". I highly recommend this toy.\n'

aS"\nThis movie is great, and full of action.  I was never a fan of wrestling and knew very little about the Rock.  I rented this movie last night for my boyfriend and I to watch. Since I was strictly informed not to get any chick-flicks, I figured this was the best choice.  It is based on a true story about a guy named Beauford Pusser (gross name) who after comming home from the millitary notices a great deal of change in his home town. The mill he and his father once worked at is now closed and the main source of income for this small town is the casino/strip club owned by his former friend.  Things turn ugly whe Chris Vaughn (The Rock) notice the casino is cheating their customers.  He tries to go to the police and they are just as crooked as the casino, so the Rock takes matters into his own hands.  Great movie choice for ladies wanting to please their boyfriend with a non-chickflick. But don't worry ladies even if you don't like the story line, you will still enjoy it, because the Rock is very nice to look at!! Enjoy.\n"

I purchased this Panasonic microwave for the office because I own two other Panasonic microwaves at my personal properties and I am delighted with the brand.\n \n This microwave not only looks nice and clean, but it stands up to use and abuse of the employees.  I also have not had any complaints that it doesn't heat food properly.  I would certainly recommend this microwave to anybody.\n"

aS"\nI recently bought the C75 Beertender as we prepare for the fall football season and we love it- here's why.\n *\tHeineken is the beer of choice in our house, so when we saw the mini draught kegs in the grocery store, we knew this would be a nice alternative to the bottles and cans we normally buy for our gatherings. \n *\tI am a big a fan of Krups products; I've always used a Krups coffee maker; I can't live without the pannini grill and recently purchased the fully automatic espresso machine- which we love. When I saw the Beertender, I knew we had to have one in our house. \n *\tWe have beer on tap all the time! Does it get any better then that? The beer stays at the perfect temperature, it doesn't take up any room in our refrigerator and it tells us when the keg needs to be replaced, if we exceed the 30 day freshness period. (So far we have drained the kegs before that date happens but we have come close)\n \n I'm thinking this will be a great present for all the beer lovers in our families.\n \n \n"

aS'\nMany books on the subject of ghosts are either silly and trite or leave the reader with many unanswered questions. This book is different--and better. Mary Ann Winkowski claims to see ghosts (earthbound spirits) and is able to speak to them. If you accept that premise then the book\'s content is fascinating and answers many questions. Readers can and should be skeptical about such claims  but if one reads the book with an open and curious mind it will be an enjoyable and enlightening read. It certainly makes you think. What happens to us after we die is always a compelling topic. "When Ghosts Speak" approaches the topic with ideas many people have not fully considered before. If you enjoy an easy, page-turning read about a topic that has always fascinated humankind, you will not be disappointed reading this book.\n'

aS'\nFirst off, I\'m an otherwise very happy Xbox Live Gold member. Instead of buying a points card from a retailer, I made the mistake of buying the points online from Microsoft through the Xbox. I used my gamer tag account and entered my credit card on the TV and I bought 500 points. I got the email confirmation that I bought the points. I then used the points. So far so good. \n \n Over the next two days, four other Xbox charges totaling $30 mysteriously appeared on my credit card. Someone bought more points and a game subscription using my credit card info. I called Xbox Live support- their answer was "we don\'t give refunds." I explained that it\'s not a REFUND if my account is used fradulently. They still said no. \n \n Note that clearly the security leak was with them, as no other fraudulent charges appeared on my credit card...just Xbox charges.\n \n I then asked them to delete my credit card info from my Xbox Live account. They said they could not do this. I could not believe this! Given that someone had access to my credit card and they were unwilling to remove my credit card info, I had no choice but to cancel my credit card.\n \n My advice- buy the points from a trusted source like Amazon. Don\'t ever give Microsoft direct access to your credit card info. I hope this helps.\n'

aS'\nJudging from the reviews here and the vast difference between the people that enjoyed the book and the people that hated the book you can tell that the author hit a nerve.    Although some reviews here argue that the book is just more of the same old Liberal Media; if you read the book you will find a very well-written and thought out documentation of the state of the current "media" and that they have moved past center and into the land of the conservative right.  The book is very good with just a bit of nastiness thrown at the far right conservatives that have attacked he author in the past (and after this book has come out thouse attacked have increased).  To be honest I was concerned the book would be a bit dull given that I had seen a few interviews the author gave and he did not come across on TV as a very engaging person.   Well his writing style is the polar opposite of his "on air" personality.   He is quick witted and sharp.   I just did not find anything objectionable about the book.  What I did find is enough ammunition to argue any case of liberal bias in the media with anyone.  How, after reading the book, you would not come to the same understanding as the author I do not know.  You would have to be so set in your current mindset that no amount of proof and well-constructed argument would change your mind.   Then again people still swear Elvis is alive.   Overall the book was great and a must read if you are interested in the media or liberal politics.  It is all the proof you need that the "Liberal Media" is a long incorrect statement that gives the far right another name calling opportunity.\n'

aS"\nI just got my Ultimate Blu-ray edition in the mail and it isn't entirely what I was expecting.  The blu-ray disc, the photos, and the soundtrack are awesome, however, the jewelry box is made out of cardboard and the bookmark is nothing special.  The bookmark just says Twilight on it.  I have seen better bookmarks on other websites sold separately.  The bracelet is decent.  The watch looks like a kids watch that you can purchase out of a gumball machine.  I am mostly just happy to have the dvd, but for $80, I was expecting the quality of the other items to be much, much better than they were.  Overall, it probably would have been better to buy the blu-ray disc separately and then shop around at other websites, like Etsy.com, for the other items made from better material.\n"

aS"\nI heard this book discussed briefly earlier this year on the Today Show and decided to order it since, at the time, I was in the throws of my own divorce.  Ms. Gilbert chronicles her international journey of self-discovery with such amazing detail and tenderness and humor that I recommend this book to anyone who has found him or herself in a place or state that he or she would like to change or leave (I imagine, that's everyone!).  The story is engrossing and the writing is skillful.  I couldn't put it down, and I feel more empowered to follow my own dreams and heart after finishing the book.  That's 5-star material if I've ever seen it.\n"

aS"\nI've been using the Kodak Z712 for the past couple years and LOVE it. However for vacations, it was a bit bulkier then I liked. I didn't want to downsize from a 12X zoom to a 3X, so I just continued using it till something else caught my attention. Enter the Z1485. An AWESOME little camera.\n \n I received the camera in mid-December. I used the battery that came with it, a non-rechargeable KLIC-8000 Li-Ion. It lasted about a month, all through Christmas (during which I took MANY pictures) and regular daily pics (I have an 11 month old, so I take a lot!). I just changed the battery a few days ago to a rechargeable KLIC-8000 Li-Ion. If you purchase this camera, MAKE SURE you buy the correct battery for it. Of course it's going to suck up regular AA batteries, it's a powerful little point and shoot.\n \n The picture clarity is fantastic (keep in mind, I'm just a casual picture taker. Day-to-day pics of my son, and family trips). All the pics I've downloaded to my Kodak program and printed out have come out beautifully. I normally use the smart-scene, but sometimes (like during Christmas) I use other settings, like the candle light setting for pics of the Christmas tree. They came out perfect, all nice and soft. The size of the camera itself is perfect...I actually bought an ipod jogging case for it so I can wear it around my wrist or arm during vacations (nice to always have the camera handy), and it fit just fine. \n \n I've always used Kodak for their simple no-brainer approach to picture taking, and this camera fits that to a tee. I'm so glad I upgraded. I'll always love my Z712, but this little guy has everything I need. PLEASE do not be dissuaded by the mediocre reviews here. Most people know NOT to put regular AA batteries in a digital camera. It sucks the life out of them in no time. With the proper batteries, this camera is light, clear, and does an all around GREAT job!\n \n"

aS"\nThis machine is yet another good example of high quality Hitachi engineering.  This compressor has outlasted several other brands.  The machine has run two finishing guns continuously for almost a year and  hasn't needed anything more than an oil change The regulator is  predictable, and adjusts as easily as other brands.  I firmly believe that  Hitachi gets 4.1 CFM out of 14.5 amps.  We simply do not run out of air no  matter how fast we are working with the Senco SFN40's.    Down time has  been zilch.  One thing we did add was a water/oil separator and filter to  protect our work and our guns.  I suppose Hitachi (and most other brands)  leaves these off so that they will have a competitive price.  But it does  not make economical sense for YOU to leave them off.  While I have given  this compressor a 5 star rating, there are some things for the engineers  (and you!) to think about in the next model:   1. The way the regulator is  mounted it is difficult to make a manifold for two hoses without hanging  those pipes out there where they can get knocked off.  Anyone who has  knocked one off before will know that A) everyone in the neighborhood knows  it right away and B) it puts you down for some expensive time.  And C) when  this happens, it often creates an unwanted projectile.  It took me three  street elbows and an hour of figuring to get the quick disconnects in a  safe place. 2. When you pick the unit up with the handle, the unit tilts a  bit.  This means you have to hold it out away from your body a bit more  than the size of the compressor would promise.  All that horsepower weighs  enough to make this more uncomfortable than need be.  We just bent the  handle with a torch to get on the center of gravity. These are relatively  small gigs on a really great compressor.  I only spent so many words on  them so that the engineers might just read this.  It seems they will have  plenty of time to correct this before the ones I own wear.\n"

aS'\nNo, doubt the far left will be outraged over Laura Ingraham\'s "The Obama Diaries."  I think Laura Ingraham has brilliantly exposed the Obama Regime\'s hypocrisy of change you can believe in.  The Diaries are done in the tradition of Alice in Wonderland.  You know Ms. Ingraham has hit a nerve when the lame stream media i.e. MSNBS, ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN are outraged by the Diaries. Laura Ingraham is right on in demonstrating the total disconnect between the American People and the alternate Obama Universe of trashing are traditional values, and dividing our Nation on racial grounds and class warfare. I am sure that Obama Diaries will be a best seller, to the dismay of Ms. Ingraham\'s Critics. Ms. Ingraham Critics should remember the more they condemn the Obama Diaries the more books will be sold. I am sure Ms. Ingraham is laughing as she goes to the bank.  Job, well done Laura.\n'

aS'\nThis micro SDHC card is the best in the US market. Samsung has developed a 32GB one but it is only available in Asia at the time of this writing. With that said, this is a good card. I bought it for my Blackberry Curve 8300. If you are going to use it for a Blackberry, make sure that you have the Blackberry OS 4.5 or later as it will not read the whole 16GB if you do not.\n \n Even though this is a Class 2 card (the 16GB Class 4\'s, like the 32GB cards, are only available in Asia right now), it reads and writes fairly quickly. The card is fast enough to record and play videos on my Curve, and saving a couple minute video after shooting it literally takes seconds to write.\n \n I have two minor gripes about this card, and they aren\'t that bad. One is the price. You can get an 8GB card for less than half of the price of this one. However, it is still "new" so that\'s the penalty for being an early adopter.\n \n The other gripe I have is that with the Samsung reader (see the bundle Amazon sells with this card) will NOT format this card in anything other than FAT32. Now the Curve can\'t understand NTFS, so for me it\'s not a big deal, but for someone who may want to use this as take away storage, just be aware of that.\n \n Other than that, I think this card is great. Also please note this card DOES come with an SD adapter. Don\'t let the Bulk Packaging fool you. If you have an SD card reader, you will not have to go out and buy a separate card reader for this. Save yourself the 5 bucks if you can. I hope this review was helpful.\n'

aS"\nFrom the first announcement of this device, I was prepared to dislike the iPad, on paper it has way too many flaws. With one in hand and actually using the device, I can honestly say it is an excellent, gorgeous, piece of hardware. The biggest flaw, it weighs a ton. The weight doesn't sound like a bad thing, but after I held this device in both hands while laying down, my arms got sore. It's a small thing, but you should be aware that it is heavy.\n \n Set up was super simple. Connect the unit to your computer, run iTunes, follow the wizard. About 5 minutes later the iPad is set up and activated. The wizard does call it an iPhone for some strange reason. If you have an iPhone already, the set up is a bit easier. It will inherit most of your settings.\n \n Once activated, you have to unplug the unit and then go through the settings application to set up your wireless network and a variety of other settings. All pretty obvious, top to bottom, essentially all the same as the iPhone. \n \n Do note that the charger is a 10W charger - much larger and different from the iPhone's 5W charger. So you'll have to use that charger. There is a big negative, you'll have to cart around that charger, most USB ports will not charge this device. My beast of a PC has plently of power on all the USB ports, and it will not charge my iPad. External battery packs will work with no trouble charging, or extending the use.\n \n Battery life - I ran video, downloaded a ton of apps, and played with this thing for a solid 2 hours - 10% of the battery life was used. I would guess that reported battery life is right accurate. \n \n Typing is easier than on an iPhone, but still not keyboard easy. There's a big problem with how to hold the device and type at the same time. I was a master at Blackberry typing with my thumbs. I can't seem to get it with the iPad. The other problem, the device has a rounded back, so if you place it on a table and try to type, the thing rocks back and forth annoyingly. I don't think I will spend a lot of time typing long emails on this device. \n  \n Apps that are built for or converted to the iPad format are simply gorgeous. They are full of detail and easy to read. Old iPhone apps that have not been upgraded are all blocky and not so great (useable but not great). You have the option to click the app back to native size if the jaggies bother you.\n \n Safari works really well on this device. The browser is a real live browser that displays WebPages beautifully. Bookmarks snap up in an instant. Pages load at almost lightning speed, actually faster than on my desktop computer (quad core 3GHz, gigabit wired connection). There is almost no need to have multiple pages open, since load times are so fast and the favorites menu is so easy to access. There is just no comparison to the iPhone's horrible display of WebPages.  \n \n Email takes on a whole new look. Embedded pictures display beautifully. There is a pop up ribbon to select email from your inbox. Navigation is just a pleasure. Account switching is a little different from the iPhone, but still very intuitive. Apple seems to have figured out how to make the email experience more intuitive and remove the unnecessary from view. \n \n Video is stunning. Netflix over high speed WiFi (my connection is 22Mbps) delivers full screen, highly detailed, smooth video with good sound. Any video created for the iPhone plays, but they are significantly pixilated or blocky, basically you've blown up a video designed for a three inch screen to three times that size. Those videos are viewable, but I will be reconverting my source video to the larger size. \n \n Some of the free apps I've tried. ABC is simple and stunning for watching video, but lacks a lot of programs. Craigslist adds the ability to view pictures in the preview of a listing, something not available on any other computer - very handy feature. USA Today has done an awful job, the interface is horribly confusing and pretty well useless. Weatherbug is incredible, simple and to the point, but with a ton of forecast information (including webcams for different weatherbug stations). NASA is silly, an enlarged version of their iPhone app. Pandora works perfectly as expected. \n \n The iPod / music side plays like I expected. Nothing really new there. The oddity though, iPod / music is on the home base menu, but video is a separate application. Everyone would expect that Apple got the music player right. \n \n I've had an iPhone 3G for almost two years and have disliked almost every minute of use. I got it for work email and it sort of delivers on that promise. The iPad is what the iPhone should have been all along - fast, simple to use, and a gorgeous screen. I also own a netbook. The iPad is a much better device. \n \n I love this device. Is it a revolution in computing? Only time will tell. For the moment, this is the best video, audio, email, web browsing device I've ever seen. \n \n Go try it at a store. I think you will fall in love.\n \n April 11 Update - Kindle versus iPad - I own them both. The Kindle is the better e-reader by a long long margin for avid readers. e-Ink is easy on the eyes, it looks just like a book. Where ever you can read a book, you can read a Kindle. The Kindle is light weight, about on par with a real book, maybe a bit lighter. And the plastic has a really fine satin feel. After about ten minutes reading on a Kindle, I don't think of the device anymore. The iPad - pages look gorgeous. Winnie the Pooh is absolutely stunning, with the color images, the perfect page layout, sharp beautiful type, fun page turning animation, and a kind of 3D look that mimics a book. But, it weighs a lot more than a book, more like a big old heavy text book. The hand feel - aluminum and glass - not as wonderful as the Kindle. I keep thinking, this is such a cool device that I don't lose myself in the reading. \n Buying books with the Kindle is a super snap, under a minute and I've got my book. Buying them with the iPad? Sorry I'll never buy a book through iTunes, just like I've never bought a song at iTunes. Amazon has the review world covered and they know how to sell books. \n \n But, and here's the big but, the majority of the public is going to love the iPad reader software. They will marvel at the color pages and love the book buying experience, just like they love buying music through iTunes. It will be a success. The avid reader will stick with paper or a Kindle, or a Sony reader, or a Nook. There just is no substitute for e-Ink. And, yes my eyes hurt reading the iPad screen; and no you can't read a book easily in the sun (especially not the beach). \n \n And if you think I'm silly saying the device is heavy - there's three pretty savvy tech people that agree, Patrick Norton (a big strong guy) and Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla (an intense WOW gamer, so she has strong hands), and Molly Wood of CNet. Molly has returned her iPad because it is too heavy among other reasons.\n"

aS"\nI have had a small double-chin problem that bothers me a lot, cosmetically. I have also suffered periodically from neck soreness. When I saw this little gizmo on TV, I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a try through Amazon, being nervous about the high pressure I might get from the direct TV phone number. I have used Neckline Slimmer now for five weeks, and I am amazed and happy with the results. First of all, I and others have noticed a clear difference in my double chin. This past week, at least three people asked me if I had lost weight, and the truth is, I've lost none, but my chinline is firmer! Moreover, a positive side effect that I did not expect is a very tangible strengthening of my neck muscles. This aspect is noteworthy and has helped me improve my posture and overall comfort.\n \n So, I have gained confidence and muscle tone. I plan on using this apparatus for the rest of my life, and will give it as gifts to others, especially those with neck problems. \n \n My advice: use the Neck Slimmer as suggested. Don't overdo it or your neck might get sore. Do the full routine while sitting in the correct posture. Don't go too fast to the strongest coil; rather, use the coil that feels most comfortable, and work your way up. (I have not even started using the strongest coil yet, so my great results come from the middle strength coil.)\n \n My guess is that the poor results described in the other comments come either from expecting too much too fast, or by mis-using the apparatus. I for one am a very satisfied customer, especially considering the very moderate cost and the mimimal time needed each day to do the exercises. I recommend this highly!\n"

aS"\nAlthough it has 10 workable buttons which come in handy for some games, it has some major flaws. On some games, if you press Up on the gamepad you go Down, and when you press Down you'll go up. The directional pad is totally useless, games where you need to move the D-pad rapidly, forget about it!! The buttons in the back eventually get stuck. You can't use any other Gravis controller while this one is in use. And on top of all that, not even the uninstaller works right. When you goto uninstall the controller, it screws up your computers registry files. It was a nightmare just to get my computer working again. I'll never buy another Gravis gamepad again.\n"

aS'\nI\'ve had an opportunity to use Office 2010 Beta edition for a couple of months now and now that I see the full, final, edition I can say that this is a very worthwhile upgrade. First things first, I am not a techie. I am someone who uses Word, Excel and PowerPoint on a very regular basis, who really liked some of the changes in Office 2007 but who thought some things needed tweaking, so when given the opportunity for the beta edition I jumped on it and have not been disappointed. Office 2010 is to Office 2007 what Windows 7 was to Vista; that is, there are not many breakthrough, drastically different features, but a whole lot of polishing and cleanup to make it easier and more efficient.  Overall, the program seems to run faster, incorporates many of the most commonly used options and makes them more accessible (eliminating many dialog boxes and tabs) and allows for more customization.\n \n At first glance it looks very much like its predecessor, the ribbon is back and it is now also found on OneNote.  There are plenty of sites that will give you a play-by-play on all the features available in this new version, so I\'m just going to mention some of the biggest improvements that I\'ve seen.   \n      1)\tThe biggest change is the addition of the web apps.  It may not be a true direct competitor to google docs, but it   allows for easier sharing of documents, as well as making your documents more accessible.  \n      2)\tThe ribbon is back and it now includes the "File" option and a new feature called "Backstage view."  Backstage view incorporates the most commonly used actions in one place (yay! no more dialog boxes with tabs).  You get the usual open, save and print, but you also get several templates for new documents, print layouts and ways to share your work, all without dialog boxes and tabs, everything is much more easily accessible. \n      3)\tAnother new feature is that the ribbon is now customizable so you can organize it according to your needs.  \n      4)\tThere is a Paste Preview which lets you switch between paste options so you can make sure that your work will be formatted correctly.\n \n Changes in PowerPoint.\n You can now edit video directly on PowerPoint. You can trim a video, add effects, fades and even triggers for animations for the presentation.  Another new feature is that you can add effects and edit images without the need for third party software.\n \n Changes in Word.\n One nifty new feature in Word is called "Navigation pane," which replaces the old document map. It incorporates minor changes in design that make big changes in productivity and ease of use. It allows you to quickly rearrange the document. Take for example a document with several headings/sections.  The Navigation pane provides a list of all the headings.  The headings are live, so you can drag them up or down, thus rearranging the document.  It also incorporates most of the functions that used to be available in the "Find" dialog box but now they are all visible so you don\'t have to go digging through several menus to find the option that you need.\n \n Changes in Excel.\n Most of the changes in Excel deal with very large datasets. There is a new PowerPivot add-in which works great if you are dealing with a very large dataset that does not fit in one Excel spreadsheet. PowerPivot pulls the data from multiple sources (several Excel spreadsheets for instance) to analyze it.\n \n Summary:\n Overall this is one well planned and executed upgrade that essentially takes all the promises of Office 2007 and makes them a reality. Yes, some things are different, and it will take some getting used to; but, once you realize the improvement in efficiency you\'ll agree that the changes are mostly for the positive.   The only thing that I truly wish had changed but didn\'t is that this version does not include Outlook. That is available in the Home and Business version.\n \n'

aS'\nThis is a very sturdy, attractive product that is just as nice as those much more expensive. And despite being sturdy, it\'s easy and light to move all over my condo. Rectangular shape is perfect for smaller spaces -- same square footage as square play yards, but the rectangle shape fits easily into more places (like bringing it into the dining room when the sit-down dinner went on too long for a one-year old; the square play yard would not have fit). I\'m an urban grandma and did not want anything with primary colors. The navy looks very nice with my decor. I was worried about the lower price, thinking the play yard would be inferior.  Don\'t worry.  It\'s not.  Happily, this is not a case of "you get what you pay for."  I\'m very pleased with this play yard, my granddaughter is happy in it.  Great play yard.\n'

aS'\nI have been a long time user of the Gillette Manual Fusion Razor then I bought a ProGlide Power Razor about 2 weeks before it was actually released and all I can say is WOW...this razor is by far the best razor out there today, no doubt about it...This razor makes shaving a breeze and it does not drag across your face, nick or cut you in any way...it provides the closest shave you can possibly get without going into an "old-school" barber and getting a straight razor shave..Yes, the blades are expensive but you really do "Get What You Pay For" so if you want cheap blades then expect a lousy shave with cuts and knicks..if you want an extremely close and comfortable shave with minimal effort then this is the razor for you...I recommend getting the Power Razor as it really does make a difference while shaving and it does provide a closer shave than a manual razor..Also, get rid of that crap-in-a-can gel or foam and get yourself some natural cream that you lather with a badger brush (Truefitt & Hill, Proraso, etc) and you will really see this ProGlide Power come to life..A+++ razor that I will continue to use no matter the cost of the blades...Face it, us dudes have to shave daily (or almost daily) so why go cheap and tear up your face if you do not have to..\n'

aS'\nDespite the fact that this is a "Dummies" book, it is actually quite detailed and scientific in nature.  A good review of basic facts in regards to male & female bodies, esp. for those of us who have been out of sex ed for a while now.  Also provides some thoughtful information for "beginners".  \n \n It also includes interesting extra facts & information, like sex during pregnancy, sex during menstruation, the importance of prostate & other male/female exams, interesting pros & cons of different positions, etc.\n \n Also, Dr. Ruth\'s personality comes through in the book, which is generally a good thing.  She adds a touch of humor to this book, though at times a bit too quirky...  \n \n Overall, a good book for the topic and probably useful for parents wanting to speak to their kids about sex (or if they are too uneasy to give them the talk directly).\n'

aS"\n&quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot; is one of the most interesting, powerful books I've read in a long time. Audrey Niffenegger did a beautiful job taking some of the most complex ideas - time travel, marriage, love, children, friends, literary and artistic allusions, religion, death, drugs, childhood, growing, loss, and what it means to be human - and weaving them together poetically and with amazing clarity. Her characters are wonderful, &quot;real&quot; people with strengths and flaws, and I really grew to adore them. Despite skipping around time at the same rate as Henry, the time traveler, the events are sequenced in such a way that you still witness each character's growth as a person, as well as discover many surprises along the way. Clare and Henry's story is one of the best love stories I've read in a very long time. This book also echoes important modern-day questions about the appropriateness of gene therapy, and what it means to be a human being. I highly and enthusiastically recommend this book.\n"

aS'\nI was initially upset because I paid for 1 day shipping early enough to "receive" it the following day...however it was not "shipped" until the following day.  It arrived after I had left for a weekend trip out of state (Still hoping to qualify for a reimbursement).\n Ok my gripe session is out of the way...shipping has no bearing on the quality of the product.\n \n I got to use it for the first time this morning and I am thrilled with it.  This is my fourth Nuvi...I upgrade every so often and this was one I could not resist.\n \n One of the features that I noticed right off is that, for example, you are driving down the highway and you slow down to take an exit ramp...it will zoom in as you are slowing allowing you a better view.  LOVE THAT.  \n \n The free traffic is a bonus and it\'s accuracy is OK...not great but OK.  \n \n The display is phenomenal and definitely a fingerprint magnet, but in no way distracting while being used...mainly when it is turned off will you notice the prints.\n \n One of my favorite features is the additional data you can choose to display on the right hand side of the screen.  I have current time, Arrival Time, and Distance showing on mine...it is customizable though and you can choose what you want to display...including Direction of Travel and Elevation.\n \n It is a true Groovy Nuvi in that Garmin makes the best GPS units on the market(My opinion) and this one allows you to have your cake and eat it too.  Not to mention the icing is great.\n \n Garmin even has a program you can download for free from your online account called voice studio.  If you are tired of the same old computer voices, have your spouse or child record their voice and then upload onto your 3790T...Very tempting, indeed!\n \n If you want a true state of the art, top of the line unit that has all the bells and whistles, you can\'t go wrong with the Garmin 3790T.\n I\'m still getting used to all the amenities and am having a blast with it so far (I have an hour and 45 minute commute each way to work)\n \n'

aS'\nFirst, I am not in the expected fan base for Jonas Brothers.  Not by a long shot.  However, their lyrics are clean and their hooks catchy and the boys aren\'t hard on the eyes; all of that has me won over before hearing anything else.  In their new CD  the songs aren\'t just catchy, they are flat out contagious.  If I am not listening, I have found myself singing or humming the songs.  Repeatedly.  I have to hand it to JB for maturing their sound in the right way.  Most "boy bands" go on the extreme of "we\'re not kids anymore" when they try to branch out their sound.  JB has done it right: writing relevant songs to their lives in a sophisticated and mature way.  The band boasts a wider variety of instruments and the metaphorical writing suits them wonderfully.  Another positive (for me at least) is being able to hear more of Kevin\'s singing.  He\'s still all harmony but at least you can tell it\'s him singing.  That\'s not been the case in the songs I\'ve purchased before.  Overall, this CD is excellent.  It\'s clear the guys will be around for a while and they and their fans won\'t be doomed to bubblegum for the duration.\n \n World War III: 4/5  Angsty and fiesty and fun.  A bit hard to listen to the first go round because it is so aggressive but by the end you\'re sold.\n \n Paranoid: 4/5  Their first release from the album.  Definitely one you\'ll find yourself humming when you aren\'t paying attention.  I always think I am sick of it until I hear it again and then I realize that, nope, it\'s still pretty good.\n \n Fly with me: 5/5  From Night at the Museum 2 and honestly, one of the best tracks.  We still get the bubbly and sweet lyrics but the music is something more than just catchy.  "Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine..." lyric just seals the deal for me.\n \n Poison Ivy: 3/5 Most contagious track by far, literally and of course, metaphorically.  We all want what isn\'t good for us but we all hate that we want it.  Redundant lyrics but insanely awesome music.\n \n Hey Baby: 3/5 Good but not great.  Catchy but not memorable.  Filler song for me. (Update: After listening to this song more, I appreciate it more than when I wrote the review.  If I had to rate it now, I would actually give it a 4/5.  As far as songwriting and performance goes, it\'s probably a 5 but it just doesn\'t have the memorable catch that Fly With Me or Turn Right have, so I can\'t give it a full 5).\n \n Before the Storm: 4/5 Thankfully Miley doesn\'t over-sing and the writing and performing of this song are tender and sweet.  It is clear that Nick and Miley mean every word.\n \n What did I do to your Heart: 5/5 This song is just F-U-N, fun!  Love the country influence.  The only improvement that could be made is Kevin on a banjo.\n \n Much Better: 4/5 Brilliant. I\'m a T.S. fan but what a joy to see her get a dose of her own medicine.  While it\'s never stated to be directed at her, honestly, you can\'t help but to raise an eyebrow at: "Got a rep for breaking hearts/ Now I\'m done with superstars/ and all the tears on her guitar/ I\'m not bitter..."  Really been waiting for Joe to get some sort of say in the matter and this satisfies me completely. My only issue with this song is that it doesn\'t need a horn and guitar solo both.  I\'m sure it will be great live, but too much for the CD. (Update, I did see JB live, with my daughter this summer.  It wasn\'t their full set since they were actually only headlining a city celebration.  They did play this song and I have to admit, I didn\'t notice the horn and guitar solo being as cumbersome as it was on the CD.  Either they trimmed it, or it was just so amazing live that I didn\'t have time to notice it.  It really does play better live.)\n \n Black Keys: 5/5  Nick\'s experiment with writing on the black keys of the piano.  Hauntingly beautiful melody is the result and the lyrics are typical, tender Nick.\n \n Don\'t Charge me for the Crime: 2/5  Like WWIII, it takes a listen or two but then you can appreciate it.  Complete metaphor for how far you should or shouldn\'t go to help a friend (are people actually taking the lyrics seriously?)  Clearly an experiment and here you see(hear) some growing pains.\n \n Turn Right: 5/5 My absolute personal favorite on the entire CD.  The all acoustic suits them so well when they let themselves commit to it completely.  Kevin played piano on this at the Wal-mart sound check concert but doesn\'t get any listing on the CD for it, so I don\'t know if he recorded the piano, but if so, it\'s cool to hear him play other instruments.\n \n Don\'t Speak: 3/5 They say they wrote it in the vein of U2, Kings of Leon, Mutemath and some others.  I hear U2 all over it the most.  Not my favorite song but an absolute cross-over to my age bracket (mid-30s) if they were aiming for that.  Definitely a slower paced song for them as far as story telling and theme.  Will do well though on radio play if they choose to release it.\n \n Keep it Real: 4/5  Bonus track from their sitcom.  Classic JB, catchy and a little kitchy but absolutely fun.\n \n Completely worth every penny whether you\'re 12 or 32.  \n \n Update: Even though very few of their songs actually rated the full 5 stars for me, the album as a whole is a great package, which is why I gave it 5 stars.  Sometimes breaking it apart piece by piece you can see the chinks in the armor, but over all, 3 months later, I am still listening to this entire album almost daily -- not as a teenager, but a much older than these guys adult.  That alone should hold up any 5 star rating in my book.\n \n'

aS'\nThis, friends, was the single book that so fatefully launched Ernest Hemingway\'s amazing and long-lived literary career. As such it is as close to being a legendary book as they come, yet some seventy five years after its initial publication, it still offers a story that is also surprisingly fresh, personal, and memorable. For all of his obvious excesses, Hemingway was an artist compelled to delve deliberately into painful truths, and he attempted to do so with a style of writing that cut away all of the frills and artifice, so that at it s heart this novel is meant as a exploration into what it means to be adult and alive. Thus we are introduced to Jake Barnes, a veteran of World War One, now forced by his wounds to live as a man without the ability to act like one, forced by impotence to forgo all of life\'s usual intimacies, and all of its associated life connections for which he so yearns. At the same time, Jake attempts to live a life of meaning and purpose, one crammed full with activity, work, and friendships. Yet it is within this network of friendships and connections that he must confront his painful circumstances.  Enter his true love, the feckless Lady Ashley, and indeed the plot thickens, for we soon see how Jake\'s physical affliction has painfully affected several others. Ashley loves him, but needs a virile man who can give her the physical love she needs. While Ashley is a woman of uncommon beauty, she is also virtuous enough in her won way to want the one man she truly loves to be her lover. Like all of us, she wants most that which she can never have, and so she returns to the source of her own dilemma time after time to Jake, her emotional match, the one man who cannot give her the mature emotional love she craves. So they are condemned to circle around each other, even while some of their friends and other members of the in-crowd interfere, compete, and seek Ashley\'s affections around the edges of the continuing affair. What we are left with is a modern tragedy, one in which the characters must somehow resolve the irresolvable.  Yet for all this emotional turmoil and existential `sturm-und-drang\' of the so-called "lost generation", people drowning in the moral anomie and circumstantial wasteland created in the gutters of their own endless wants and needs, it is most often Hemingway\'s imaginative and spare use of the language itself that wins the reader over. Unlike his predecessors, he sought a lean narrative style that cut away at all the flowery description and endless adjectives. In the process of parsing away the excesses, Hemingway created a clear, simple and quite declarative prose style that was truly both modern and revolutionary. What one encounters as a result is a story seemingly stripped to its barest essentials, superficially more like the newspaper man\'s pantheon of who, what, where, when, and why, and yet somehow transformed into a much more accurate and imaginative effort, one leaving the reader with a much more artful account of what is going on. One reads Hemingway quickly, at least at first, when one learns to slow down and drink in every word and every detail as it is related. For me and for millions of others, the true genius of Hemingway is to be found in his artful use of language. This book was Hemingway\'s first truly successful foray into the world of letters, and the result changed the face of modern fiction.  Enjoy!\n'

aS"\nI had my reservations going in to see this one, but it was surprisingly funny and didn't have to use much gross-out, potty humor or profanity that seems to be pervading many comedies these days in attempts to humor people. Instead, there was more slapstick style humor, and while it is the classic lovable loser meets girl scenario (except at the mall) and has its predictable moments, over all it was a pretty decent comedy. \n \n King of Queens star Kevin James plays Paul Blart, a long time mall security guard who is a bit lonely in life because of failed relationships. When he sees a beautiful woman working in the mall, he tries to figure out a way to connect with her, but his awkwardness gets in the way of his progress. Training a new mall security guard isn't what it seems to be, as this supposed high school dropout turns out to be the brains behind a massive robbery and hostage situation. It is up to Paul Blart, the only one who takes his job too seriously, to try and save the day. \n \n The first part of the movie was funny, but some of the gags were awkward at times (trying too hard to be funny). What James brought to the character Blart was kind of a Chris Farley/John Candy kind of persona.  I thought that the later half of the film was better, even though as usual you have to throw reason out the window. \n \n Not too bad of a film, and dare I say, it might even be one you could take a date to see.\n"

aS'\nI own many digital cameras, but this HP product is great.  I love the touch screen, easy to move around to the different features.

aS"\nPros: This mouse does everything that I've read in all the reviews including the slight jittering of the mouse.  However that is easily fixed by removing the silver/embossed ring around the sensor that reads 5600 dpi sensor, etc.  A quick e-mail to the support at Razer will net you a teflon ring to place into the ring (the mouse however will work fine with nothing there).  I have always preferred wired mice being a very competitive gamer, I would never have chanced my batteries going out on me at a key time in game play.  However this mouse allows you to have the best in both wired and wireless gameplay.\n \n Cons: I wish it weren't so expensive, but you can't always have it your way.  I'm a little leery of having the Razer software update the onboard mouse memory, Synapse, every time I open it to make a change; but that is a fairly minor problem as long as it works.\n \n At the writing of this review, a firmware update is available from the Razer website that solves the problems that many have been experiencing with the battery not charging to full capacity.  I can confirm that this update solves the problem.  Thumbs up to Razer.\n \n"

aS'\nFor me, this is an incredibly difficult movie to review and critique.  I feel that the movie did a phenomenal job of developing the story; however, the acting in the movie left something to be desired. In case someone has not seen the movie, I do not want to give much of the story away.  An asteroid, classified as a global killer (a global killer meaning that if it impacts earth, there will be total destruction of life), is on a collision course with earth.  NASA comes up with the idea of landing on the asteroid, drilling a hole, and dropping a nuclear weapon in the hole and blowing up the asteroid with the intent of splitting it in two and altering its path so it misses earth. While it is a simple story, the movie does an exceptional job developing the plot into a 2-hour movie.  The movie incorporates a "gloom and doom" plot with a second story of love, romance, and hope.  The first plot is about an oil driller and his band of misfits attempting to work with a group of highly educated astronauts and military pilots to drill a hole on the asteroid (and of course the work together as well as Worcestershire sauce and ice cream).  The second story line involves one of the oil drillers falling in love with the owners daughter.  The relationship reminds me of a terrible "teen-age" relationship with the seemingly perfect love that young people share coupled with a resentful father who seems to not want to lose his daughter. It is difficult to explain how well the two story lines integrate without ruining the movie for someone who has not seen it.  While the plot is superb, the acting in the move is just so-so.  I thought the acting of the three headline actors (Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler) was weak at best; they had their great moments, but mostly their acting seemed almost emotionless.  I did think a couple of the lesser known actors (mainly Michael Clarke Duncan as "Bear" and Peter Stormare as the Russian astronaut) were incredible in this movie. Personally, due to the overwhelming depressing plot about the end of the earth, I don\'t think this is a movie I would cuddle with on the couch with a new date.  However, I nonetheless think the plot is excellent  and I do highly recommend seeing this movie.  I give the movie 5 stars for how the movie integrates the two story lines together and develops them into a great plot, not the acting in the movie.\n'

aS"\nI've used this overgrip for years now, and I refuse to use any other overgrip. I realized that, after shelling out some real money for those dinky 3-packs at Sports Authority or Modell's, I stumbled across the 12-pack offered on Amazon and, well...I got it! \n \n This isn't a real big deal, but I really like the way the individual grips are packaged. They are more folded than rolled, which prevents the overgrip from rolling up by itself after you've unraveled it. Again, NOT a big deal, but an added bonus IMO. \n \n The texture of this grip is just tacky enough where it doesn't interfere with quick grip changes. It is, however, sticky enough to adequately stay in your hand without you having to worry about a slippery handle. \n \n I don't remember if other colors are offered, but to me, WHITE is pretty classic on a tennis racket. Maybe it's because Federer uses it, and I love the guy, but regardless, buy this package of grips and be content!\n"

aS'\nHere is this product\'s obligatory page-long review.  I drew some basic comparisons to two other Verizon phones -- the Samsung Omnia i910 and the LG Dare.  I hope this review may ultimately save some of you some time. :)\n \n I have been looking for a phone with a high-resolution, fast camera, and PDA-like features.  I use the camera when traveling to clients\' premises, and am surprised how many devices made by Apple, RIMM, Palm and others treat cell-phone cameras as an adolescent feature that wastes the time of employees (like surfing emails and internet cannot be abused this way).  As someone who needs the coverage of the Verizon network in my area, not too many phones fit into the above two categories -- particularly without the need to buy a $30/month data plan.  I intentionally delayed using my NE2, knowing that Verizon often releases phones in June.  After nearly choosing the Samsung Omnia i910 and LG Dare, I\'m glad I did.\n \n I read in other Amazon reviews that some user\'s of the Sammy 910 made the effort to set the phone up properly so that they didn\'t have to dig through menus.  But personally, I found the i910 very difficult to do almost anything, even with shortcuts right on its desktop, even after trying it out 6 times at Verizon stores.  I\'d hate to tell a relative, "Here\'s my phone, go make a call!"  It\'s excellent 5mpix camera almost convinced me, but it was too hard to text in either landscape or portrait, and it requires the $30/mon data plan, plus has a non-standard headphone jack.  The LG Dare was much simpler to pick-up an use, although (without having tried calibration adjustments) I found I made mistakes every time I did a sample text message with it\'s touch screen, in either orientation.  The camera was also slow at times, especially when using auto-focus, taking as much as 2 seconds to take a picture, and more to wait for the camera to prompt you with the save/erase options.\n \n Enter the enV Touch (and in some similar respects, the LG enV3 VX9200 Phone, Blue (Verizon Wireless)  or the LG enV3 VX9200 Phone, Maroon (Verizon Wireless) .  Finally, a company has figured out a way to keep a real, non-touch-screen qwerty board embedded in an updated, semi-smart phone, especially for those of us who cannot or do not like haptic-feedback touch screens.  Personally, I prefer the center-located space bar, although some of the older enV user\'s may need time to get used to this.  The keyboard, with my fairly large, iron-grip hands, is easier to use than any touch screen keyboard I\'ve tried, and the 3.2 megapixel camera is one of only a few Verizon phones that offers better than 3 megapix resolution -- shameful in my opinion.  Pictures snap quickly too, in less than 1 second.  The full 3" screen viewfinder makes you feel as if you are using a devoted still camera, although I\'m noticing that I have to be a bit careful how I hold the phone so as not to cover the sensor.  This will improve with practice.\n \n But about that front touchscreen -- I am very impressed.  Even without a hard keyboard, this would have been the first phone from any US provider where I can actually type out a text message, completely error-free, using only the traditional numeric keypad in portrait mode.  And getting there is easier too -- the tab-up feature to use the touch screen is very easy and intuitive.  Screen resolution is very good, though perhaps not quite as leading edge as the iPhone or Storm color and resolution.  However, the screen is large enough to see the touch keyboard and a large enough portion of a text or email message without having to scroll through as much as with the Dare/Omnia.  But the phone is also fast -- my old Motorola motorazr had ongoing slow-responsiveness to pictures, notepad activation, even ringing for incoming calls!  The enV Touch is fastest phone I\'ve used, with a near-instant 1/4th second or better response to opening or activating almost anything.  This iPhone-like device also does not require a data plan if you just need a feature-rich cell phone without always-on email.  However, at $1.99/MB, I will have to try out email push and browsing to see if a data plan may yet be desirable.  I travel to Canada frequently, and hope not to have any "always-on" data roaming fees -- I have read horror stories about iPhones incurring $600 bills as owners blithely cross borders or even roaming within the US.  But to my current, possibly wrong understanding, I don\'t think this phone automatically data-roams.  The phone also offers airplane mode and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack -- finally, no more need to take an iPod and cell phone and camera with me on trips.  Now only if we had unlocked GPS...maybe this will work with Google Maps?  Another interesting device I\'m looking at purchasing is the Motorola MOTOROKR T505 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone  which blue-tooths the phone\'s audio or phone calls to the car stereo -- safer for calls and convenient for music.  Another nice change:  The CLEAR and END keys on the front screen are well separated now -- no accidentally erasing an unsent message when you thought you were backspacing.\n \n It\'s not perfect.  Despite the terrific 16GB capacity, Verizon\'s menu system still retains a 200 text-message limit.  Wha??  After nearly 10 years with this design, couldn\'t this be a tiny bit larger by now?   Of course, that\'s a Verizon issue, not really LG\'s mistake, but since this phone is currently only used on Verizon\'s network, it\'s an issue.  The phone is a little bit wider at .61 inches than comparable, non-keyboarded competitors.  I gladly accept this trade-off for the convenience of two styles of keyboards though.  It\'s also little taller than the similar enV3.  So far, that\'s all I can say on the con side.\n \n As much as I love the touch screen, it\'s still not what I\'d consider a true iPhone contender though, which with a new release today, seems like it still has a more vibrant display and of course much better apps.  But the enV Touch was, for me, the closest Verizon phone to the iPhone, if only because it seems so intuitive, and it is easily the best cell phone I\'ve ever owned.\n \n As I use the phone, I will update the review with notable pros and cons.\n'

aS"\nMy son received this for his 2nd birthday a few weeks ago.  He loves to mow just like his dad and is always asking to go outside to use his very own lawnmower.  He even takes it with us on walks around the neighborhood. We have not had any problems with bubbles- you just have to push it continuously to get good bubbles.  You won't get any bubbles if you only walk a step or two then stop.  However, he loves it even when there are no bubbles- he just wants to mow.  I love it because it is sturdy and not at all annoying like some other (talking) mowers on the market.  I would absolutely recommend this toy!!\n"

aS'\nThis book is a great read, and a lot of fun into the bargain. This is the  story of a little-known British anti-Nazi espionage plan to divert attention from D-Day in Sicily. There has been brief mention of this tale in several books concerning the British spy systems during WWII, But never before have all of the actual real-life details been revealed. If you enjoy reading of the derring-do exploits of some during war time, this is the book for you. If you are interested in the history of WWII, this is the book for you, if you enjoy spy stories- this will suit you to a "T".\n \n The tale begins inauspiciously enough with the combination of a poor Welsh laborer and aristocratic MI5 officers, it proceeds through a poor Spanish fisherman and the halls of power in Germany to Hitler\'s desk! The results of all of this chicanery are astonishing, resulting in a triumph for the Allied forces that leads to a successful invasion of Italy.\n \n This tale encompasses stolen bodies, massive cover-ups by the British government, a veritable warren of European spies, and a submarine. The book is well written and consuming, the type of book that one reads in 1 day, because one can not bear to put it down until all plot twists are revealed. The review copy did not have many illustrations, but I would imagine that the final book itself will be well-provided with images of the protagonists, doesn\'t matter- the book grips you with vivid descriptions and thumbnail sketches of it\'s own. \n \n For all WWII buffs, lovers of European history, spy thriller fans and many others, this is the book for you. Hugely recommended !\n \n'

aS"\nThis system is wonderful for a starter set. If you're a college student, new to surround or looking for something simple for a smaller room, this is a great choice. The biggest plus about this system is that I can hook up my Xbox (RCA hook up or digital). Keep in mind that If you hook it up with RCA you can't get surround, but the stereo sounds amazing. I was afraid of Coby from all bad reviews on other systems. This one really exceeded every expectations. Very clear sound, great price and a great DVD player make this perfect.\n I'm 21 and live in an apartment so the rooms aren't that big. I have a 100 sq. foot living room. This system is just right. When you finish setting it up (took me about 30 min, running cables and all) you need to put in a DVD like Lord of the Rings to test out the sound. If you leave everything at the default you'll notice that there's almost no bass and the center speaker is WAY over powering. Play around with your setting for a while, you CAN get bass out of it, just look through the menus.\n"

aS"\nI didn't realize that the author of this book is also the same person that has the television show.  I don't regularly watch Nancy Grace on TV but I've caught it a few times when I was channel surfing.  Like when I've caught her on TV, I was glued to the book from the very beginning.  This book gives plenty of visual details and the writing flows easily.  It usually takes me a bit of time to warm up to a book and get to know the characters but this one had me from page one.  It is a quick read being only about 350 or so pages so to me it is like a good suspense thriller movie.  I am always looking for reading material to keep me on the treadmill and this fit the bill.   I liked it!\n"

aS"\nIf you dont have a twisted sense of humor like most T&E fans then you won't like this DvD. However if you are like me and you cant get enough of this show, then you will love this DvD. The extras are hilarious (Gettin' It Dunn is a personal favorite) and of course the episodes are unforgettable. The only beef I have with this DvD is that it has no commentary. T&EASGJ! season 1 had commentary on the DvD and I loved it, season 2 and 3 don't and I wish they did. However this is still a sweet DvD so get it.\n"

aS"\nI'm about as happy as I could be with the Impact case.  Carrying around a slippery, glass-fronted device, I was primarily looking for a case that would provide good energy dissipation in the inevitable event that I drop-kick it across a room when fumbling for keys.  As such, an unyielding hardshell case just wasn't ideal.  The fitment, bracing, and silicone material of the Impact are a well-thought-out means of limiting shock intensity (although I thankfully haven't tested it to any considerable extent).  \n The Impact fits the phone snugly, provides a good textured grip for the hand, and doesn't drown out the mic and earpiece like poorly-fitted units. All slides and buttons are easily accessible - perhaps even more so than without case since my hand isn't slipping all over the glossy shell.  Relatedly, the Impact adds very little size to the phone and weighs next to nothing.\n The included screen protector works great too - I'd heard of rainbow refractions and a slightly-milky appearance, but cleaning the surface well beforehand and working carefully resulted in a crystal-clear application.  Can't tell it's even in place.  No complaints on that front.\n I could do without the circular port on the back of the case, but it does nothing to harm structural integrity and it displays my MS sticker effectively. ;) It will certainly do the same for the Apple logo, however!  The thickness of the silicone protects it from most direct scratchin' contact.\n My second option in terms of cases was the Otterbox Defender, but I felt the Impact would suffice for day-to-day protection, and thus far this has certainly proven to be true.\n"

aS'\nOk, let\'s start with the top question: Do you or I really need another upgrade of Photoshop Elements? Is it vastly different than (6.0 or 7.0) and should this be my digital photo editing and organizing software of choice? I will cover the main points of the changes from Version 6.0 and 7.0 in this review. I have also reviewed Photoshop Premiere Elements 8  which is the video editor, and comes as a package option with Photoshop Elements 8. \n \t\n Photoshop Elements has two components-- an editor, where you do your digital picture manipulation, and a file organizer or album where you store and retrieve your images. The interface for the editor is the same whether or not you use Mac or Windows, so if you are switching from one OS (say, MAC\'s at school, Windows at home) you will be very comfortable with Photoshop Elements. Where the systems differ, however, is in the file organizer and this is understandable; the Organizer function involves organizing and retrieving files, so this is going to be different depending on your computer operating system. \n \n Since I don\'t have access to a MAC, and since I don\'t know much about them, I\'m going to be reviewing the Windows version only from here on in this review. For your information, I\'m currently using Windows Vista 64 Home Premium Edition. \n \n My computer system used for this test is an HP Pavilion with an AMD Athlon 64X2 2.70 Dual Core CPU 5200+. I have 4 GB of RAM. The Video card is NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 wtih 128 MB of video memory.  This is an on-board video card (on the motherboard) and if you are doing heavy image work, and video, you might want a separate, more capable video card.\n \n Minimum PC Requirements:\n \n Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7 \n 1.6GHz or faster processor\n 1GB RAM  (MINIMUM means MINIMUM; you really will need 2GB of ram to be comfy)\n 2GB available hard disk space\n Microsoft DirectX 9\n Color monitor with 16-bit color video card  \n Internet Access for online features and help\n \n \n One immediate, small but great change from Version 7.0 is that when the software is initially booted up, the Welcome Screen is rearranged; on the left side: simple buttons EDIT or ORGANIZE. On the right, access to tutorials and underneath, info on your Photoshop online account (space available, links to your personal URL and online organizer.)  Version 7.0 had tab buttons along the top of the welcome screen and was visually more confusing. THIS IS A GREAT IMPROVEMENT. THANK YOU. \n \n A big change from Version 6.0 is the workspace, which is now dark gray in color (I actually don\'t like this--the gray is depressing, but I understand visually it is far less distracting and lets you focus on your editing job.)  The workspace is now adjustable. However, if you are a change-o-phobic or just habit-bound, you can return the settings to look and feel like previous versions, for example, the fixed-window workspace of Version 6.0 can be retrieved in the Application Frame in the preferences window.  There are other big changes, mainly the organizer, the online content, the personal online space and some editing tools; more about these further on in this review. \n \n In addition to the change to the Welcome Screen, there are changes to the interface where you access your tools. The palettes have been renamed as "panels" so I got confused a bit again. I\'ve been using Palettes for years with editing software; palettes of filters, layers, colors. So, now, they are PANELS, and you can do this right in the panel itself at the bottom. This is also a significant change from Version 6.0 (7.0 does have it.) The big change to 7.0 however, is that the layer controls are now their own panel below the Layers panel. The old dialog boxes are being replaced by these drop-down panels. \n \n \t\n Getting down to brass tacks; the biggest change from 6.0 to either version 7.0 or now 8.0 by far, is the Organizer. Not only is there an automatic "organize my images for me" feature, but there is an optional online storage feature that has many uses.  The main change from 7.0 to 8.0 has to do with an improved ability to add key word tags and to manage your  media.  If media management is an issue for you, this upgrade will be worth your while. \n \n Another big change in Version 8.0: do you open multiple files at a single session? (I often download a photo session from say, a parade or one event.) Beforehand, you\'d have to go to the file list in "Open Files"  and pick which ones or all the ones you want, and try to scroll through them at the bottom to find the photo you want. Now you can open multiple files and use tabs to switch between them. This is huge. If you don\'t like point-and-click, you can employ a keyboard shortcut of Command-~ (tilde) to page through the open files.\n \n The main change to Version 8.0 is the Organizer. When you boot up the software and have those choices, Edit or Organize, initially you are asked to set up an online account at Photoshop.com. You don\'t HAVE to do this. And you are then asked if you want to organize your photos, and this is the real advantage; the system combs through your hard drive and pulls up your images, and organizes them (like Picasa and other organizing programs) into a set of albums. The last six months are available with a single click, or you can organize by other means. \n \n If you key-word tag your photos when saving them, and use the Smart Tags (everything from photo quality (good, bad, over, underexposed, face, etc) to event tags, you can create albums and quickly export them to DVD,CD, online albums, or hard drive. If you do a lot of image work and don\'t want your main hard drive cluttered with images, or if you want to back up your images onto an external drive, this is very handy.  The organizer is one major reason to move from 6.0 to 8.0. Organizing a large number of photographs is made seamless and easy with the organizer that appeared in Version 7.0. I didn\x1at think I\x1ad need it, but I do need it and I use it. In fact, I need to get better at using the tag feature. This is very good for the increasingly difficult task of finding and retrieving older photos. \n \n  \n You get 2GB free storage online at Adobe Photoshop.com\'s site, so if you sign up (as is suggested in the Welcome Screen), you can have an offsite, online backup. If 2GB is not enough storage for you, you can pay for Plus membership. Plus Membership starts at around twenty bucks (at this time) and you can go from 20GBmb (about 4 hours of video storage) to 40, 100, 250 or 500GB of storage, with prices rising accordingly. There are other perks such as advanced tutorials, and some bonus art and video effects, but the main reason for upgrading from free is to obtain much more online storage.  I used some of the themes for the slide show and there are a few included, so the temptation is very strong to spring for the extra twenty bucks, get the ten-fold increase in storage (easy to fill it up) as well as the larger selection of themes. If you use Premiere, the adjunct video editing, you get increased storage for videos, and movie theme materials for "instant movies." I will be reviewing Premiere 8.0 separately, but you can see that if you intend to use the complete image-plus-video package, you probably will want a Plus membership. I was surprised to find out (me, the minimalist) that I did also want the upgrade. Film buffs and Youtube fanatics will want the extra storage; video takes a lot of space, and you are permitted to upload a video of up to 2GB with basic membership.\n \n \n In version 7.0, Adobe introduced a much-improved Photomerge funtion. I use this function a lot to make composite photos as well as panoramas and other interesting landscape creations and group photos. I was not happy with the previous Photomerge in versions 6.0 and prior, but I used it a lot as a shortcut to cut-and-paste multiple images to make a composite. Version 8.0 improves Photomerge and adds a very interesting and useful feature: you can combine several exposures to create the "perfect" digital exposure. Take one shot with flash and one without. (Yes, the no-flash shot is too dark; the flash shot is sometimes washed-out or the shadows look funny.) Using PhotomMerge Exposure, you can get a new, improved "best-of-both-worlds" photograph. Here\'s my take: if you have Version 7.0 and you do a lot of photography, this is worth the upgrade alone. \n \n Two new editing tools, Recompose and Smart Brush, tools also are slick ways to merge and fix photos with a lot less fiddling around, or by using some smarts built into the software. For example, you can reformat a wide photograph, remove a lot of blank space and recompose it to have the figures closer together, but not distorted. I used to do this by a very involved cut-and-paste procedure, copying figures I wanted to move and covering over unsightly elements like road signs or utility poles; this is a lot faster though I still need to do some clever editing myself if a pole appears "growing" out of the top of a subject\'s head (a huge photographic boo-boo) or if there is some goofy kid mooning you or mugging a funny face in the background of the shot (I shouldn\'t be telling you this, but a fun way to ruin someone\'s vacation photograph is to sneak into the background as they compose their award-winning photo of the Eifel Tower or Mount Rushmore and cross your eyes and stick out your tongue. Kind of a human version of that intruding squirrel of internet fame.)  Using Recompose, you can remove these offensive things more easily. \n \n There are templates to make cards, calendars, frames and other artwork. I am not into that kind of thing, but it\'s there for those of you who do scrapbooking, especially digital scrapbooking or who make your own birthday cards or Christmas newsletters. I used the slideshow template and I loved it. I wanted more...but the themes as I mentioned previously, are limited in the basic, included online edition. You have to spring for Plus membership to expand those selections of themes. \n \n No major changes to the filters. Pretty much the same as Version 6.0, with the changes to controlling the interface as I mentioned before. The biggest change to filters is in the smart brushes for photographs. I have been using the filters a great deal ever since Elements was introduced, to pre-compose paintings from my digital photos. They seem pretty much the same as in earlier versions though the adjustments are now easier to manipulate in the Filter Gallery.  \n \n This question comes up all the time: is 8.0 FASTER??? I didn\'t notice any difference loading 8.0 and 7.0. Definitely, versions 7.0 and 8.0 are much faster to load than 6.0, at least with my computer.  \n \n Re tutorials, manuals and help; as usual, help is online content though a pamphlet on Getting Started comes with the box of software. In addition to the online content for help, there is a "Tips and Tricks" hyperlink in the Welcome Screen (lower right). This takes you online to a web page with tutorials. The tutorials include what\'s new in Version 8.0, various help for video editing (this will be covered in my review of Premiere Version 8.0.) You can search for other tutorials, and even submit your own. Tutorials have a rating on the right (one to five stars.) When you click on a particular tutorial, you will see the author, a way to favorite it for future reference, and on the right, you can add your own rating of it. \n \n Summary:\n \n Version 8.0 has a few great new improvements over Version 7.0. It is not vastly different than 7.0 but the Recompose, PhotomMerge Exposure and some of the adjustments to the panels are advanced enough to make this a significant improvement if you like to do digital photography. It is quite different from Version 6.0 so if you have not upgraded and these features appeal to you, I think it would be well worth it to get the improved organizer and the improved tools. \t\n \n Recommendation: If you are on 6.0 or earlier versions and your PC meets the minimum requirements, do upgrade to 8.0. If you are on Version 7.0 and employ the media organization, upgrade to 8.0 \n \t\t\t\n  Joanna Daneman\n \n \n'

aS'\nI\'m suspecting that there are two types of people who are approaching this DVD, a filmed version of the stage production of "Jekyll & Hyde".  One, someone familiar with the show--perhaps saw it and liked it or has the soundtrack--and wants to check out this variation.  Or two, someone discovering it anew.  It tempts me to write two reviews because while I love "Jekyll & Hyde", it\'s slightly unfortunate that this is the production most people will get a chance to judge.\n \n So let me preface this by saying that I really am a fan of this show.  Some people consider "Jekyll" sort of a "Phantom-lite".  I, myself, have never been the biggest supporter of "Phantom of the Opera".  It\'s fine, full of bombast, but hardly the revolutionary experience that people give it credit for.  "Jekyll" does play to similar themes, but has a stronger overall soundtrack.  Instead of a couple of showstoppers like "Phantom", "Jekyll" is filled with memorable power ballads.  Not the most complicated show musically, it is very accessible.  And when you have great singers, these simpler and emotionally charged songs become pop opera and quite moving.\n \n So, without hesitation, I recommend the original Broadway Cast recording!!!  Robert Cuccioli, Linda Eder and Christiane Noll are superb.  You couldn\'t hope for better.\n \n But here\'s the problem with this DVD, it\'s not this great cast--NO, the star is David Hasselhoff.  So you see my problem, don\'t you?  Look, I\'m not going to be unkind--it\'s an easy target.  Let\'s just say this.  If you\'re a fan of the show, he doesn\'t completely ruin it.  And it\'s not like there are any other versions to add to your collections.  If you are new to the show, I\'m still recommending it provisionally.  I wish there were another option.  If you like the show, though--and I think you will--please rush over and buy the 1997 Cast recording.  Treat yourself to how "Jekyll & Hyde" should really sound.    KGHarris, 10/06.\n'

aS'\nWe previously owned a smaller slide from a knock-off company and it finally tore apart after two summers of hard use. Despite the spotty reviews on this one, we bought it for half retail price in the Fall and gave it to our kids (4 and 6) for Christmas.   Oh the pain of having to wait for warm TX weather to use it!  But it was so worth the wait.  We have used it several times now with no problems and the kids are THRILLED with it.  Here are my tips and observations:\n \n Dump a few ounces of tear-free soap at the top of the slide ramp and along the outer edge of the curve.  This has many benefits: It helps to prevent fabric burns on knees, elbows, shoulders, etc that come into contact with a dry part during sliding.  It makes the slide a bit faster.  It creates bubbles in the pool part, which the kids enjoy.  It helps to clean the fabric and gives it a nice scent (instead of mold). \n \n When the kids are done, drain the pool, grab the top handle of the stair part and flip the whole thing upside down while it\'s running.  This allows water to come out of the footholds and the air chambers.  (I\'m not sure why this slide takes water into the air chambers along the bottom, but it does.  And for some reason it leaks back out much better upside down.) Finally, you\'re going to want to allow a couple hours after use to keep it up and running in order for it to dry.  Be sure to drag it to a dry spot in the yard so it\'ll dry underneath too. If you fold it up damp at all, it will grow mold.  (They all do that.)  \n \n Yes it\'s heavy.  It\'s a huge water slide.  But I\'m a 5\'3" woman and I can set it up and take it down by myself.  In fact, this is the very first inflatable I\'ve ever had that I could actually get to fit in the storage bag provided.  It takes some precision folding, but I\'ve gotten that sucker into the bag all by myself every time. \n \n My last tip is that this is actually fun to use dry as well.  You won\'t be able to slide on it, but my kids have spent hours of imaginative play with it in the evenings after school this spring.  They pretend it\'s a ship and they sit in the crow\'s nest (top of the slide) to look out over the ocean.  They throw out anchors in storms and save mermaids and lots of other missions that require endless trips up and down the ramp.  Our own backyard theater production.\n \n So far no problems with any rips or tears in the seams, and that\'s even with two jack russells that constantly jump onto the lower air chambers, with their sharp little talons.  I highly recommend this slide, but it\'s not worth retail price.  Find it like we did at half price, no tax and free shipping... That\'s a deal worth buying.\n'

aS"\nHow does linkin park do it. meteora has excelled all my expectations as I could not believe they could match the brilliance of hybrid theory....But they did.  Track overview. 01.This is an awsome start to any album and blends perfectly with track 2. 02.Don't Stay- A great opener, fast and hard. The chourus grows on you but it is the brigde which stands out and you find yourself yelling with chester. 3.5/5 03.Somewhere I Belong- The single. The intro to this song is so addictive i find myself playing it over and over again. Good song, not the best. 4/5 04.Lying from you-Chester's voice in this song is so powerful and it is impossible not to yell with him. The chorus is again awesome but is let down by the rap. 3.5/5 05.Hit the floor- the major dissapointer of the album. The rap is to similar to previous efforts and the chourus offers very little. 2/5 06.Easier to Run- this chorus is one of the best in the album and blends perfectly with the brige at the end. One of my favourites. 4.5/5 07.Faint- The best song on the album. The intro is incredible and the rap blends so well with chester's chorus. A hard song with the best yelling bridge on the album. 5/5 08 Figure .09- Good song. the chorus isn't as catchy as others but the rap is a stand out. Not original enough. 3/5 09 Breaking the habit- An original an unlike any of their other songs. A quiet song in comparison and the opening scratch with the strings is awesome. Good for a change. 4/5 10.From the Inside- A major stand out. I love this chorus. It has awesome lyrics and is easy to sing with. The best mix of rap and singing to date with an awesome brige. 5/5 11.Nobody's Listening-Again very different.the intro with the pipes sounds sweet. Good rap. Good Chorus. 4/5 12.Session- Dissapointing. Nothing compared to track 11 on hybrid theory where Mr Hahn went off. 1/5 13.Numb- Another great song, easy flowing and again good to sing with. Great lyrics, another favourite, good closer. 4.5/5 *** An awsome album...linkin park has created another masterpeice with every intro being different from the next but being so effective.  Best songs- 03,06,07,10,13\n"

aS"\nThis item arrived in excellent condition. Plugs directly into the cigarette lighter socket and powers up immediately. Can't read the display from the drivers seat, but it's too far away anyway. If you need to view the whole process, you can always purchase a device extender that plugs into the outlet and gives you a couple of plugs to hook into.\n \n I decided to go with an 8 gb flash drive which I loaded up with music. Plugged it into the transmitter, found a blank radio station and used the two buttons on the transmitter (located on the outer edge) to match the transmitter with the radio frequency. Once it is matched, I can go back and forth 3 spots with the switches to get the best sound.\n \n The sound quality is as good as my system can put out. It does pick up static here and there, but anyone I've talked to that owns an FM transmitter mentioned that. It's the norm for this type of device. \n \n You can go forward or back a song with another set of buttons. You can also use the remote, which works fine, to go to specific songs or jump ahead 100 or 200 songs. You hear a distinctive audible beap when you push the remote. Songs seem to be in the same order all the time and if you know the number of a specific song, you can punch that number on the remote and it will jump to it. \n \n Using the flash drive, I've unplugged it, put it back in at a later time, and it started on the song that last played. You do need to unplug it when you are done driving, because the unit is always powered up.\n \n I have to give it 5 stars because, it performs as described, it has a cheap price and works as good as the ones that sell for $40, and you can plug various devices into it.\n \n I've only owned it for a month, so I can't report on the durability of the unit, but I am extremely pleased with it at this point.\n"

aS"\nThe Scent of Rain and Lightning by Nancy Pickard was the best novel I've read in a long time. The first couple of pages grabbed me--there was no reading half the book before I decided I liked it.  Pickard writes in an easy style about people and life in Kansas, but it could be any rural/ranching setting.  The characters were described so perfectly that I felt like I grew up with them.  This is a murder mystery, but it's definitely not your typical who-done-it.  The plot unfolds gently--no harsh, sharp twists and turns.  It's also a love story and a story of a close-knit family.  It has everything but nothing is contrived; it's all very natural and believable.  I think the best way to describe the book is that it's a gentle, easy story about some ungentle events. I can understand why Pickard has received so many awards. She is a great American author; in my opinion on the same level as Twain and Steinbeck. This book is a MUST READ.\n"

aS'\nThis book gives you and amazing and in depth look into the lives of these highly social, complex monkeys.  Primatology has often  been dominated by studies on apes, but the Lomas Barbudal project has brought us leaps closer to understanding primate behavior by dedicating decades of intense research to this species of new world monkey. Reading about some of the daily family, political, and terretorial dramas of the white-faced capuchins, you cannot help but see just how similar they are to us.  These are some remarkable and intelligent capuchins just bursting with personality.  They are problem-solvers, drama queens, pranksters, lovers and fighters. I highly recommend this book to any primatologist or person interested in social behavior!!!  This book has some wonderful photos and gives you glimpses into what it is like to be a primatologist in the field. It is a great resource!!!\n'

aS'\nWhen Reno the Dog\'s cop companion, Lou Swanson (Carmine Caridi), is killed by a \'white supremacist\' group of terrorists, he gets teamed up with tough cop Jake Wilder (Chuck Norris) to bring the bad guys down.\n \n As you may have noticed, my movie summary for "Top Dog" was done in one whole sentence. That\'s because the story itself is quite simple for all audiences. It\'s the classic formula: good guys vs. bad guys. There are no `in-betweens\' or `switching\' of the good and bad so it\'s easy to keep track of who-is-who.\n \n Unfortunately, though the classic formula `good vs. bad\' most often works well, "Top Dog" had more `bad moviemaking\' going for it than any `good moviemaking\' to make this movie worth watching. Of course, it IS entertaining, but how far will one go to be `just\' entertained?\n \n Chuck Norris, never really being known for his acting abilities, seems at times to be enjoying himself but on the whole, he just lets everything flow on its own. Not once does he try to make his character his own, unique one. But that could be because the director does not really give him a chance to really do anything.\n \n Instead, the audience is made to suffer somewhat by having to endure a bigger version of `Benji\' for the hero of the film. There were mixed reviews on Amazon as to whether they liked Reno or not but in my opinion, Reno just did not impress. While, no doubt about it, we are continually made to believe that Reno is very intelligent (and sometimes he IS), there are times where he\'s just annoying. The ending was too contrived and moments where Reno is supposed to be cute just doesn\'t come out well. To sum up, everything Reno does is nothing special. If you\'ve seen other `dog\' movies like "K-19" or "Turner and Hooch", there is nothing in "Top Dog" which you haven\'t seen before.\n \n The music was also badly done, especially the scene where the terrorists are trying to take out Chuck Norris at his house. The whole scene is supposed to be exciting, but the music utterly throws all suspense out. And... the terrorists are wearing clown masks?!?! \n \n Ultimately, I believe that the main thing that went wrong with "Top Dog" is that the filmmakers couldn\'t quite make up their minds whether to make this a movie for children or for adults. While rated PG-13, the movie seems to be aimed for a younger audiences with having Reno the Dog as a main character. But at the same time, having terrorists and some violence would have children turning away, especially the murder of Lou Swanson. Adults however will probably be repelled from the storyline and the fact of having Reno the Dog in the story. \n \n So, in conclusion, "Top Dog" can hardly be considered a classic so I really won\'t put this on my `recommend to others\' list. My advice, if you still want to watch the movie, probably better to rent than actually buy it. Trust me, it\'s not worth it. The only thing that might interest viewers is watching Chuck Norris `do his thing\', or shall we say, using his fighting skills. But definitely not top-notch stuff compared to other kung fu movies.\n'

aS"\nFor starters Amazon delivers on their promise of a 3-day delivery. This is a company you can count on. \n \n The Zx1 is right on target. Right out of the box it does exactly what you would expect from a small pocket video camera - decent quality and simple operation. Even indoors the quality was acceptable - which is more than you can say about most cameras in this class.\n \n This is clearly a second-generation pocket video camera - with improved controls and support for large capacity SD cards. The AA batteries are just what you need to make sure you will never run out. I was surprised to see that a charger was included.\n \n My big concern about buying a Flash Drive HD camera was the issue of file format. This is a thorny issue with all HD video cameras. I could care lass about HD - I just wanted decent quality and the ability to edit video. \n \n The plan is simple - archive the 'HD' content and keep it for future editing when software and hardware are readily available. And meanwhile\n convert the files to AVI or another usable DVD formtat for immediate use.\n \n The supplied ArcSoft program does primitive conversion of the 720p format to 640 DVD format - but in Quicktime - which Windows Media player version 9 still refuses to recognize in Windows XP ( I hate Vista)\n \n There are many third party programs which do a better job of conversion - the one I use is AVS Video Converter 6. It took the raw MOV file from the SD card and converted it to AVI format with the 720 lines preserved and good sound quality. As with all such conversions it is slow but the quality is excellent. This is not a trivial conversion. Of course AVS will convert it to any of a dozen other formats - some with smaller file size - but none with higher quality.\n \n Since this camera is so new, the Kodak web site has very limited documentation for the Zx1. They avoid entirely the issue of file formats and that is because it is a thorny issue. Along these lines I should mention that without loading any software, you can slip the SD card in your computer slot and you will get a MOV file. It comes up as a Quicktime file. My version of Quicktime played the movie O.K but there was no sound. I'm sure an update is available - but it may not be free.\n Of course my Quicktime player did play the MOV file after it was converted by ArcSoft. \n \n Hey for $150 - this is a great buy and it seems to be durable also.\n \n  \n \n \n"

aS"\nI bought this camera a couple of weeks ago and it is small. Smaller than I expected, but that is not a bad thing, it is easy to carry around in a vest pocket or coat pocket. I didn't download or use any of the software provided with the camera, I have Sony Vegas on my computer. One thing that I do recommend is downloading the free SDCOPY software you can find on the net. Check the widescreen box and it will convert your .MOD files to mpg files lightning quick. Now you should be able to work with them in just about any editing software. Use a card reader for the SD card instead of connecting the camera to the computer, makes life easier. I use a cheap one that came with my SD cards.\n \n Zoom is good, and a steady hand or tripod is highly recommended for longer shots. Quick to start up, the auto lens cover is great, battery life also great. \n \n I really see no problems with this great little camera, other than low light filming could be better, but not many of these cameras are great in low light.\n"

aS"\nI bought one of these before for $49.99, now it's on sale for $29.99, what a great deal.  This DVD player is excellent quality, which is something I expect from Sony.  Just about all the audio & video equipment I have at home are Sony brand, even though they are usually a bit overpriced, I'm just use to their menu system and stable quality. \n \n Playability - Sony DVD players don't play the burned or foreign DVDs, this is an exception.  It plays the Chinese Drama DVD's perfectly fine.  Not that I encourage pirating DVDs, but this one plays those self burned backup DVDs as well.  \n \n Quality - The last one I got is about 1 year old now, plays perfectly fine.  We use it about 2 hours every day.  Even at $50, it's worth the $ by now. \n \n Menu system - Well, I don't use much of the functions, but the fast forward is in place.  Samsung has a wierd fast forward where it's 2x, 4x, ( too slow)  then 64x ( way too fast).  Also, this player will remember multiple DVD stop locations even after you remove it.  Now that's really cool.\n"

aS"\nFirst off, This speaker is incredible for it's size. There is almost no distortion in sound when playing on MAX volume. It comes with a USB splitter, to charge and a 3.5mm plug so that you can connect multiple X Mini II's together. It also comes with a handy bag to store your X Mini II in. I had an Altec Lansing iM207 before this, and the X Mini II blew the iM207 away!!!. The size difference was one thing, and the sound quality was another. The iM207 also ran on 3 AAA batteries. There will also be distortion in the iM207 on full volume. The playtime with the batteries was terrible. I had to switch batteries every week, with only around 20minutes of playtime each day. For the X Mini II, it can play up to 8 hours. There are also LED indicators of when you need to charge again, and when it is fully charged.\n"

aS'\nIt has been many moons since we laughed so hard and had so much fun watching an animated film. The Fantastic Mr. Fox, which of course I read long ago, is a most stunning and hilarious treat that I know we will watch again and again.\n \n The reviews here are splendid, so I will hone in on some points:\n \n 1. Desplat has done it again with a soundtrack that kicks just right...yet he doesn\'t interfere with the terrific songs such as selections from Brian Wilson\'s "Heroes and Villains".\n \n 2. The vocal talent here is unmatched in animated experience. George Clooney pitted against Sir Michael Gambon? Bill Murray sparring with Jason Schwartzman and Wes Anderson (who voiced as well as directed)...superb! Even the inimitable Brian Cox makes an absolutely side-splitting cameo.\n \n 3. I haven\'t seen gripping stop-motion animation like this since the last time I saw a Russian animated film...and that was LOOOOONG ago. This is such a must-see for all children.\n \n 4. Saying which, I think the substitution of the word "cuss" where all cuss words would normally be used is one of the most brilliant things I\'ve ever heard.\n \n 5. In case anyone misses the point, Roald Dahl, who was decades ahead of his time, meant this story to be a basic morality play about mankind\'s greed and seeming hatred toward animals. Yet the film also shows in the most humorous way the nature of wild animals as well. Who do you think is and ought to be the victor in this?\n \n 6. Keep eyes and ears peeled for various homages and references that the kids might miss.\n \n Marvelous, and I only wish I had more stars to award it! OSCAR time for Best Animated Film feature-length!\n'

aS"\nI love the Jenny Cain series.  I have read all of them and each one gets  better as you go along.  The only bad thing that I can say is that it looks  as if Nancy Pickard is no longer writing books in this series.  I'm hoping  she will come out with a new Jenny Cain book.  I can't say enough about  these books.  The plots are great.  Please Nancy write more!!!!!\n"

aS'\nThis was so well done.  I started it in the evening and it was very late when I finished as I wasn\'t going to bed until it was done.  It\'s a bit of a romance, a bit of a gothic, but mainly a mystery of family secrets.  The story is meticulously plotted with all of my "but what about" questions answers and threads tied.  Pickard makes the reader feel as though they are a resident of this small Midwestern town and her use of the weather to create atmosphere and suspense is very well done.  The story stayed with me long after finishing the book and that, to me, is one sign of an excellent book.\n'

aS'\nI purchased the Polaroid PoGo today and have done a fair bit of "playing" with this compact little printer over the past couple of hours. In fact, I have already used the first package of 10 sheets of Zink (Zero Ink) paper that come with the printer. So my first recommendation is; if you are planning on buying a PoGo, I highly recommend getting extra paper so you can get through your "testing" phase without having to purchase more paper. However, don\'t go crazy and buy too much, there are expiration dates on the paper which may affect your picture quality if you take to long to "expose" (print) them.\n \n Connectivity:\n I have tested the Bluetooth capabilities with my Motorola Q, Laptop Computer (Bluetooth enabled), my desk-top Windows Vista computer (with Radio Shack "Bluespoon" Bluetooth 2.0 adaptor added) and my PictBridge capable Canon Powershot A 640 camera (directly connected to PoGo via USB cable) and the printer worked like a charm in all of the above tests!\n \n Speed of Printing:\n Print time is about 1 minute per photo. There was no noticeable change in print speed with any of the tests I performed. Using the Bluetooth (wireless) connection or plugging in your USB cable directly from your camera did not seem to make any difference as to how fast the image printed. \n \n Image Quality:\n Not great...but not the worst I have seen either...The pictures I printed from my camera (via USB connection) looked better than my pictures from my cell phone, but this was likely due to the higher megapixel image created by my camera versus the 1 megapixel image from my cell phone. However, the "white balance" of both my camera and cell phone images were a little "off". The whites were extremely white (almost washed-out) and the dark (shadow areas) were very dark. So if you stay away from printing bright "beach / snow" images or dark "night" photographs you will be OK. Photos with lots of color (flowers, for example) looked pretty good when printed with the PoGo.\n \n Cool things to do:\n The adhesive on the back of the photo paper is a nice feature of this product. This makes it possible to add pictures to your hand written journals. You can stick them to business card magnets and put photos all over your refrigerator. You can make photo luggage tags, cards and much, much more. \n \n If you don\'t need the highest quality image, but want to do some fun, creative stuff with photographs I would definitely recommend the PoGo. If you are a photographer hoping that the PoGo would give you a quick "proof" of what your printed images will look like, then this printer is probably not for you, since the image quality is not as good as you could get with some standard ink jet printers. \n \n Have fun...\n \n \n'

aS"\n.\n Having purchased this Waterpik about 2 months ago, I must say that it exceeds my expectations. \n \n The powerful stream of water gets between the teeth and deep beneath the gum line. The reservoir is plenty large, I actually fill it a second time for additional cleansing, usually adding a splash of Listerine. \n \n It's recommended that you use luke-warm water, but for a real good time, I'll occasionally use cold water..give it a try! It's like an electric shock!\n .\n"

aS'\nI have been using this phone for about a week now. And while this device beats previous bold 9000 in many aspects there is still much to be improved. So let me first say things that I do like about the phone. Of course the greatest improvement was the addition of the trackpad, at first it was kind of unusual to navigate with it but I got accustomed to it very quickly. Second thing is the screen resolution, it was improved from the old bold by 480x360 vs 480x320 pixels. The screen is really crisp and bright and sunlight legibility is very decent. The camera also experienced an improvement and while I was taking pictures outside on a bright day and later comparing them to the previous bold, there is a very noticeable change, pictures look somewhat close to my wife\'s 10 megapixel canon camera. I was also surprised by the improved quality of the videos this device shoots. Much better and less pixelated  than the original bold! Now for the things that I don\'t like or wished to be improved. Despite of the fact that everyone raves about "amazing" battery life on this device, I must say I am disappointed. At best, the battery lasts me a day and a half but not two day as many reviewers say. Perhaps I do extensive web browsing and chatting via instant messaging. I usually like to read various blogs and news on opera mini 5 browser and I noticed that this application along with IM+ drains battery like crazy! Of course at least now I don\'t have to carry a spare battery with me like it was with the previous bold since I am sure this one will last me for the full day.  But most often I still have to charge it every night. Which is kind of a disappointment and not what I expected after reading various reviews. Now about the browser: It sucks.... It simply sucks so much that any other smartphone\'s browser will put it to shame. But another annoying problem now that I noticed is that I can\'t get to mobile version of citibank online at all! No matter how I would reconfigure the browser... So it means no banking online for me as I used to do on my previous bold. Very annoying... The browser is still slow as hell  and only the fact that I have opera on this phone doesn\'t make it a deal breaker. I must say though that I am running a latest .405 version of the software and perhaps the issue with banking online maybe be fixed in later versions. Which I again, doubt very much. Now another disappointment is the absence of many  supported languages. For example there is no Russian support whatsoever. But than again, it may be released in the later versions. I hope so. And now last but not least is the speaker quality. In the first day of use I noticed that the speaker has been  downgraded. Instead of the three speakers which previous bold had, this device has only one and when you bring the volume all the way up you can hear a rattling noise. Not a very nice experience... Overall I like the device especially it\'s size, I was skeptical about it as I liked the bold 9000 big screen. But this one seems to be slim and looks more eye appealing.  also I like the battery cover design, you can not accidentally open it and whole device seems sturdy and has a look of a professional tool. Hopefully with next updates there will be support for more languages. But as of now I am giving it only 3 stars.\n \n UPDATE:\n \n Couple of weeks ago I noticed that phone would randomly delete data, but today was the worst: In the morning I discovered that all my contacts were completely wiped out!!! by itself! And when I tried to restore them from the backup file it would not do that saying that the file is read only. I tried this file in my old curve 8310 and it worked flawlessly. So I suspect that there are serious bugs in the OS 5.0 and AT&T is not coming up with any updates as of yet. In a mean time I am lowering score for this phone because i am very disappointed by the poor implementation\n \n UPDATE 2:\n \n As five months passed since I got this phone, I must admit I like it much more than I did before. True, I still have some issues with it, but these issues are just too minor comparing to lots of useful features that this device delivers. Previously I wrote that it deleted all my contacts from the phone book,  and last week it just happened again but I noticed that it happened after I added an another gmail account to the phone. So after I gooogled a bit I found out that gmail actually will sync your contacts with your gmail account but for some unknown reason remove them from the phone book. So basically all you have to do is to download google sync on your phone and transfer contacts back to the phone book. So I tend to believe that this issue has more to do with google gmail setup rather than the phone itself. Also the issue with the Citibank mobile site have resolved mysteriously, and now I am able to do banking through the native browser (which still sucks by the way in many aspects) I am also looking forward to the release of OS 6.0  which should include webkit browser with flash support and other new and exciting features. So I must say that ever since I got this phone it never crashed or restarted on me, not even a single time. So I must increase the rating of the phone to 4 stars as it\'s been a really great tool which I certainly can rely on in terms of usability and trust.\n'

aS'\nThe movie, "The Bounty Hunter," starring Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston was far more than entertaining. The movie as a whole was very consistent. It was a good mix, it had comedy, action, and serious moments that were very all well planned. I would go see this movie again and recommend it for everyone!\n'

aS'\nThe main characters in this film have the same names as the main characters in Nicholas Sparks\' novel, but the resemblance ends there.  While the film might be entertaining to some, this reviewer found it to be annoying and uninspiring.  The Allie and Noah in the book were portrayed as sensitive, intelligent and thoughtful individuals.  The Allie and Noah in the film are just two more average, impulsive teenagers with no special or endearing qualities and not a lot of common sense.  The reference to the elderly Allie\'s illness as "senile dementia" is misleading and inaccurate.  This reviewer recommends reading the book or listening to the book-on-tape for an inspiring love story and a more realistic and sensitive portrayal of Alzheimer\'s Disease and it\'s impact on the well spouse.\n'

aS'\nAlthough "Deep Impact" invariably gets compared to "Armageddon", I think it\'s more appropriate to compare it against all other disaster movies. Viewed in that light, it not only surpasses "Armageddon", but every other film in the genre.\n \n Unlike most disaster epics, "Deep Impact" is character driven. I think this is a direct effect of its having been directed by a woman rather than a man. While the special effects are there and are impressive, what drives this film are the emotions of the excellent ensemble cast. All of them ring true, from the occasional duplicitousness of the government bureaucrats, to the real tear jerking moments of those facing tough life and death decisions, to the small intimate moments. It\'s powerful enough stuff that I have to believe that a lot of the negative reaction the film elicited vis-a-vis "Armageddon" came from guys who don\'t like their action movies to move them to the verge of tears in public.\n \n All disaster films depend on a hook to set them up. In this respect, most fall far short of realism and believability. Of ones that come immediately to mind, only the cosmic collision movies and "The Towering Inferno" had realistic setups.\n \n All disaster films depend on the heros to come up with some way to save the day. Of the ones with a believable setup, many still fall short of believable and/or technically accurate resolutions. This is where "Armageddon" failed miserably. Mimi Leder had expert advice from NASA and it shows. "Armageddon" has some impressive training facilities shots from NASA, but ignored the actual technology. Very early in "Armageddon", when I saw the two shuttles docking with the space station by coming in from opposite directions, performing clearly aerodynamic banking maneuvers, I was ready to start pelting the screen with rotten tomatoes!\n \n Giving the devil his due, both films glossed over the full impact of operations in the microgravity environment of the comet\'s surface.\n \n Still, it\'s the raw emotions that elevate "Deep Impact" above its genre, not just the technical stuff. It\'s actually best in its quiet moments. Among the ones that clearly stand out:\n \n The president (Morgan Freeman) tries to continue to maintain an upbeat message as each plan successively fails. His press conferences and the dialog around them rings true.\n \n The dialog between the reporter (the usually annoying Tea Leoni) and her mother (Vanessa Redgrave) also rings with truth.\n \n The ultimate reconciliation between the reporter and her father (Maximilian Schell) just before the end reflects the bitterness of choices each has made in getting to that point.\n \n The reunion of the kid who helped discover the comet (Elijah Wood) and his girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski), oblivious for the moment to what was going on around them - again, this simply rings true.\n \n The astronaut observing wryly, "Well, the good news is that we\'ll all have high schools named after us." No melodramatics, no macho heroism, just someone injecting a sense of humor into a shared fate she has accepted as necessary to save the people they love. My favorite line in the film.\n \n From start to finish, this film is a class act. A realistic film that carries an emotional impact to be expected of its serious subject matter. Part of this impact is that you can\'t always guess in advance which characters will and will not survive. Of the ones who don\'t survive, not all face their fate gracefully, but all are believable.\n \n This movie began my fandom of Mimi Leder, who I consider to be one of the best directors working today - not always commercial, but always excellent. This is on my short list of my top ten favorite movies of all time. Highly recommended!\n'

aS"\nChild slavery, mistreatment of the elderly, homoeroticism....business hugs! These topics may not inspire bouts of laughter, but they are something we haven't seen before. Pushing comedy boundaries again in their second season, Tim and Eric are even more disturbing this time around and even more creative in their second season.\n \n If you enjoyed (or hated) Season 1 this one probably won't sway your opinion either way. Besides the amazing duo of T&E you get great guest stars such as Raine Wilson, Patton Oswalt, and the incomparable John C. Reilly. (as Dr. Steven Brule)\n \n This, like T&E's previous show Tom Goes to the Mayor is guilty of polarizing comedy fans on the Adult Swim network block. It's perhaps too adult for some and is maybe too silly for others. It's a great watch if you enjoy absurd and unsettling humor, though.\n"

aS'\nI have an external hard drive that is "air-cooled" but it is in a location where air circulation is somewhat blocked. This little fan takes care of that problem and keeps it running cool. I had tried battery-powered fans, but the batteries would die too quickly. If I\'m not using the external HD, I just reposition the fan to provide extra circulation for the tower. \n \n This fan is extremely quiet and works unobtrusively. I don\'t even hear it running.  Since I normally shut off my computer when I\'m done, I\'m not really bothered by the lack of an on-off switch.\n \n This fan is a great solution to one of life\'s annoying little problems. :-)\n'

aS"\nMy brother is in the Marine Corps and when I saw his old watch I realized he needed something tough. His old watch had fallen apart due to physical beatings (the face was cracked) exposed to the elements (at the time he was stationed in Arizona)and the band was cracking.\n \n I did research and came across the G-Shock. I read reviews for different models all over the internet and saw a lot of military personnel (both active and retired) give this watch rave reviews. It had the perfect amount of features (not too much, not too little) and wasn't flashy and followed his dress code for when he wears his Dress Blues and is lighter than it looks.\n \n My brother got it for Xmas 08 and he has no complaints whatsoever. This watch has been subjected to the same abuse as the other (even more now that he is stationed in Afghanistan)and still looks new. The other guys on his base even liked it and went out and bought their own.\n \n My brother says I found the perfect watch and I highly recommend it to others in the military.\n"

aS'\nThis gets 0 stars because it is a rip off of Battle Royale by Koushin Takami.  Everyone\'s buzzing over this "unique" "gritty" compelling story that\'s "Lord of the Flies" meets "1984", but I would like everyone to know that this is not any new concept.  And further more you will be much more please with the ending of Battle Royale than Hunger Games, because Battle Royale\'s ending is the perfect ending, with a twist, that no book can beat.  Plus, Battle Royale doesn\'t throw in a love story just to have a love story.  Suzanne Collins throws in a  "teen" American romance that doesn\'t reflect real romantic pressures of teenagers.  It just does not work.  You may still enjoy this book but you will be much more satisfied reading Battle Royale by Koushin Takami\n'

aS"\nI was on the fence about spending $600 on a solid crib or this one.  I finally decided on this one because as it turned out, the expensive Sorelle also used cam-locks on most of their cribs.  So that was the deal breaker.  The Kalani is sturdy despite the few cam-locks.  Grandpa had no problem with the assembly and finished within an hour.  This is for my 3rd child as I converted the old one already.  Features that were hard to find in one crib but offered in this one:\n \n 1. rich cherry finish that complements other cherry furniture in the baby's room.\n \n 2. heavy and sturdy\n \n 3. 4 height settings.  Perfect for a shorty like me to easily set down a sleepy baby.  most cribs only offer 3 settings that are either too far apart or does not make much of a difference.\n \n 4.  mattress springs.  i don't like slats or MDF panel to support my bouncing baby boy.  slats are a pain to adjust and MDP could slip and slide around.\n \n 5. toddler rail is included, which saves a hundred bucks.\n \n 6. converts to a head and footboard sleigh bed.  \n \n Cons:\n Nothing for the crib.  But I would not spend $$ on the furniture accessories from DaVinci.  $400 bucks for baby size dressers?  MDF and cheaply made?  I would recommend going to a furniture store and purchase a real dresser for less or at least comparable that will outlast the crib stage.  I have Broyhill dresser, chest, and nightstand for his room that matches the crib and I know will last after he's done with the crib (off to college and converted back to a guest room).\n \n Another recommendation: \n corner changing table in cherry.  I don't recall the brand but the color match is great and can be used as a credenza once potty trained.  fits nicely in a corner, does not take up much space.  I don't like the DaVinci changing table as it looks silly to use it as anything else with that immovable side rail.\n \n Crib bumper: PBkids- super thick and 'cushiony' or RHbabyandchild- cover removes for easy washing.\n \n I'll post a photo once all the decor is up.  So, good luck and congrats on the new baby!\n   \n \n \n"

aS"\nThe Anita Blake series -- I cannot express enough how MUCH you need it read them if you haven't already. Let me tell you the reasons why. One, the main character, Anita is tough and modern, and she could beat the socks  off of the biggest bodyguard out there at only 5'4 (with the help of some  uzis, sawed off shotguns, and her precious firestar.)  Two, the best  contemporary science-fiction/fantasy books you'll ever find. Guns,  vampires, werewolves, and necromancers are just a walk in the park.   Three, (and I feel MOST important), might I mention that taking one look  at ANY of the male characters in this book is enough to make you stop,  drool, and forget your own name? How about that delectable French fanged  popsicle with the tight leather pants, Jean-Claude? (You can bite ME  anytime, JC!) Ahem. In any case, I recommend these books to any sane  SF/Fantasy book lover out there, because I'm afraid dissapointment is not  an option. I am 99.9% sure you will fall in hopeless love with these books  after reading them, so get a head start, eh?  Guilty Pleasures is the  first book in (so far) a series of nine. Read away, m'friends...\n"

aS"\nFirst for the drawbacks; 1)It is easy to lose the balls if you don't make a point of collecting them after play and keeping them somewhere safe, 2)There is music that plays continuously while it is on, which can be annoying for some, and 3)The play cycle is rather short so you or baby must keep pressing plunger to start it again.  This might be a welcome respite for those offended by #2.\n BUT: All four of my boys LOVED this toy!!!  A favorite, and a toy I always buy or recommend to others.  Perfect for a boy or girl.  My boys were enthralled by the colorful balls shooting out of the hole and amazed when they almost always went where they were supposed to, which is around the ramp and back into the receptacle.  They also LOVED to feel the air blow out of the toy (the air is what pushes the ball up and out of the hole) and would often just press the plunger to feel the air on their faces, hands and in their hair.  They quickly learned to start the toy themselves and would be entertained by it longer than they would be by other toys.  All of my boys got this toy for their first birthdays (I am a toy manufacturers dream, I sell toys in Mom2Mom sales after on child outgrows them and then end up buying them again for subsequent kids-- can't stand clutter and feel they deserve their own stuff).\n"

aS'\nI absolutely loved this book. I became a big fan of Nicholls with his first novel (A Question of Attraction -- originally titled "Starter for Ten" with its U.K. edition.) I was a little letdown by his second -- The Understudy, which was fun, but not quite as good as his first. This book exceeds his first. He takes a great device -- following the lives of one couple on the same day over a period of 20 years -- and does a masterful job of storytelling with it. We go from the couple\'s idealistic college days -- they meet on the day of their graduation -- all the way into their late 30s, with all the physical and emotional changes that come during that timespan. We see the career missteps along the way, and all the various relationships they have while still remaining friends -- and the woman, Emma, always secretly in love with Dexter Mayhew, who has more than a few wild oats to sow before he realizes the woman he should be with is the one who\'s always been his best friend. The writing is absolutely marvelous. The dialogue is absolutely terrific -- the couple have a teasing/kneedling way of talking to each other and the reparteee between them remains funny and fresh throughout even though the novel is long -- 435 pages.\n \n To say much more would be to give too much away. But if you like insightful books about relationships that can touch all of your emotions, this is the book for you. I think structurally the way Nicholls manages to take you on an extraordinary trip from the first page to the very last is a tour de force.\n \n I had to buy this from amazon/uk because it was available in Britain a year before it became available in the United States, but I\'m so happy I got it. This is definitely a book I will re-read several times -- and I hope Nicholls continues to have a prolific career.\n \n \n'

aS'\nI got my Droid Incredible in the mail on Tuesday even though the release date is today (4/29).\n The phone is stunning...with all the simplicity you\'d expect out of a new smartphone and all the fun you\'d expect out of a Google phone.\n \n Pros:\n Android OS and Sense\n Customizable\n Beautiful Screen\n Android Market\n 8MP camera (shoots well in low light don\'t let anyone tell you different)\n super fast processor\n 7 home screens that you can view by pinching.  You don\'t have to swipe through all 7.  Makes my friends jealous.\n the browser is smooth and fast. Auto aligns text when you zoom.  uses multi-touch to pinch and zoom. Smooth scrolling and fast, fast load times.\n \n Cons\n hard to sync any e-mail other than a gmail account\n facebook app sucks, but i just made a bookmark to the full site, since the internet is super fast\n optical trackpad is glitchy but i only use it for the camera\n battery life...but Seidio is coming out with an extended battery so thats not going to be a problem soon\n \n Bottom Line:\n Honestly, I have been waiting for a phone like this every since the iPhone.  I don\'t have AT&T and to be honest I just don\'t like Apple as a company.  They make cool stuff, but they rip their customers off.  This phone is an iPhone killer.  Compare them on all levels of performance, looks, functionality, customization, and speed and you\'ll find that the Droid Incredible is the same if not better.  Also, Verizon\'s coverage is fantastic, so don\'t be fooled by 4G.  I\'m sure its great if you live somewhere where you get service.\n \n EDIT: (4/30) This phone eats RAM like crazy.  I installed "Advanced Task Killer" but I was still down to only 42M after a few days.  I would suggest downloading either "Task Manager" or "TaskPanel" (I have Task Manager and my boyfriend has TaskPanel on his Moto Droid and both work quite well).  I also suggest restarting the phone every few days just like you would a real computer.\n \n Other than that still no complaints   :)\n'

aS"\nFirst of all, full disclosure requires that I mention that I helped copy edit this book for the publisher. This means that I have a very thorough knowledge of the contents of the book.\n \n This book is not for *everyone* who plays massively multi-player online (MMO) games, but is instead designed specifically for those who are--or are curious about becoming--leaders and officers of guilds, those organized groups that are the lifeblood of MMOs. The book covers a very wide gamut within this topic, but the main take-away is that this book is helpful for ANYONE interested in guild leadership. Those who are wondering what is involved in starting and leading a guild will find a lot of information about how to create a new guild from scratch, while those who are already officers or leaders will find a lot of helpful information for topics like how to deal with churn, personality conflicts, or drama.\n \n The author includes numerous examples--many by way of personal experience--that make it easy for the reader to see how policies or situations may apply in a real in-game situation. Best of all, the author takes great care to ensure that this book is about the role of guild leadership in all MMOs; this is not a book about how to be a guild leader in any one specific game (that is, you won't feel left out that you are a guild leader in a smaller MMO instead of a behemoth like World of Warcraft).\n \n The book is organized in a way that readers can easily go directly to a section and gather practical information, and in that way. Readers should get just as much out of this by picking a specific section to read, as if they sat down and read the book cover to cover.\n \n I see this book as both a cookbook for guild leadership (that is, identifying and finding a particular topic that applies to your situation and looking up solutions), as well as a disaster prevention/management book for how to ensure that your guild runs smoothly.\n \n All in all, this is a highly detailed and unique book that should be very helpful for both current guild leaders and officers, as well as those interested in what is involved in running a guild. If you're feeling generous, consider getting this for your guild leader.\n"

aS"\nBottom Line: The author really didn't have enough time to let this mature, and didn't have a good editor. You need both to create something really enduring.\n \n I read an article the other day in the Dallas Morning News about the disposable book:  how publishers are now out to milk authors for all they can get in the short-term, with no thought to longevity or sustaining a publishing relationship. I'm sad to find this so true.\n \n I was pretty much overwhelmed by fellow teachers who are obsessed; I was actually awed the other day when two colleagues got into feverish exchange over whether Bella should ultimately choose Edward or Jacob. It was at that point that my own fate was sealed and I knew I had to read it. I digested it in less than a two-day period, and now I will quickly outline the Good, the Bad and the Ugly:\n \n The Good\n I'm surprised at the people who attack Meyer's characterization. She's actually pretty good at it. For the most part, her characters are fun, well-rounded, dynamic, complex--everything you want in a good story. Bella is believable and easy to like. I find it easy to identify with her, but as abnormal as I am, I can see how if I identify with her, others might find her completely foreign and unbelievable. :~) The only weakness that sneaks in Meyer's characterization lies with the bad guys; they're given very little opportunity to develop in relationship to the rest of the novel.\n \n Additionally, Meyer is very good at creating suspense. If nothing else, the book is a great page-turner. The reader is hypnotically bound to follow through simply by the sheer force of the words on the pages. The story itself is very easy to get lost in.\n \n Meyer definitely hit on an intriguing story-line. It's different, it's compelling. Unfortunately, it just wasn't enough.\n \n The Bad\n Meyer works a little too hard to make her 'good' vampires altruistic. There is a lot of explaining away, a lot of conveniences that in small doses do no harm, but over the long haul add up like water wearing down a rock. Further, the book is a little verbose for the material. A great deal of condensing could have been done to the book's benefit. Moreover, there are several places in the book that are meant to be one thing (like romantic) and come off as another (cringe-inducing). I sometimes felt like I was watching a personal fantasy, and whoa, that's not my thing....\n \n The Ugly\n Here's the rub: As much Meyer tries to make Edward good, nothing can atone for what he is. For Bella and Edward to go on forever the way they are is an impossibility. Everyone knows something has to give. The option given in the book, for Bella to become a vampire, isn't really allowable from a publishing standpoint. Think about it: The target audience is young adult. Most young adult readers are female. For Bella to become a vampire would send a message to millions of young girls that in order to 'get the guy' you have to cut yourself off from everyone who has previously cared about you and go through physical suffering and die an eternal death, going from human to soulless companion. Yikes! The political repercussions have me betting that Bella won't become a vampire anytime soon. The author has really written herself in a corner here, which wouldn't be fatal (no pun intended) if she could come up with something truly supernatural and redemptive for Edward to bring him back to Bella's level. But that's not so glamorous in today's climate. :~/\n \n There are other smaller problems, such as Edward's schizoid transformations from angry to humored and back, and the fact that (maybe I'm alone!) no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't envision a deathly pale and anemic looking guy who's really cold to be anywhere near attractive or sexually appealing or anywhere in Greek god territory. It could have something to do with the fact that my husband is a gorgeous blonde who just emanates vitality, and I'm too used to that, but I still found it so difficult to reconcile that it stood out to me.\n \n It seemed to me that these, and other smaller plot points, could all have been resolved with time and editing. I also found it unthinkable that there would have to be 3 sequels to resolve anything. There doesn't seem to be enough material to work with there while satisfying curious readers who really just want to know if there's any way for Bella and Edward to be together. \n \n This is a great summer read for fun, but it pains me because it really could have been so much better. Overall, Meyer is an impressive author, but this is yet another read that goes into the 'good-but-could-have-been-genius' category.\n"

aS'\nThis Korean film by director Kim Sung Soo is a visionary masterpiece that brings to mind "Braveheart" and "Gladiator."  It takes place in ancient China, where Korean missionaries are betrayed by the Chinese and are taken into the desert to die. The Mongol hordes annihilate the Chinese guards and leave the Koreans to their fate. While wandering, the Koreans discover the Mongols have kidnapped the Chinese princess, and decide to rescue her and take her to safety. This is easier said than done, for the Mongols fight back with all the ferocity in their blood.  Zhang Ziyi is the most known star in this film, but she is hardly the main character. There and great performances by Jung Woo Sung as a quiet loner and Ahn Sung Ki, the skilled archer who gives Legolas a run for his money.  The scenery filmed in China and parts of South Korea is grand, and the battle scenes are filmed with finesse and brutality. Limbs are hacked off, arrows puncture necks, and heads are severed. This film is somewhat gory, so be warned.  This film was the biggest budgeted Korean film in history at the time of its release, and it was a box office hit in South Korea. It is a wonder why this film was never released commercially in the States, when it is on par if not far superior, to the films made in Hollywood. The DVD has some great extras in the 2-Disc edition, and I highly recommend this film to fans of Braveheart, Gladiator, and other epic sagas.\n'

aS"\nI love the idea of the glamourmom nursing tank tops but when I got mine in the mail, I was shocked by the inner lining of the bra tank!  The part that goes around your areola is an itchy, meshy material.  This makes it really uncomfortable for anyone experiencing nipple soreness.  Also, you can't sleep in this top because when you roll over in your sleep, your breasts will slide and rub against this itchy, inner lining.  I think I'm going to cut out the lining and just wear the cotton tank by itself.  Wouldn't buy this again.\n"

aS"\nThis show deserves infinity out of 5 stars but I'm afraid I have to give the DVD sets only 1/5. I'm cutting the difference and calling it a 4. Why? The transfer quality is not what you'd hope for, unfortunately. I realize that this show was likely shot on video rather than film, given the budget and time period, but so were many of my other favorite late 80's/early 90's TV programs and I've seen better results on DVD re-releases than this, the technology exists to clean them up better than this, you could easily forget that you are watching a digital format and not VHS. More importantly, there are also no extras - no commentary, documentaries, production photos, interviews - zip, zilch, nada. \n \n This show was the highlight of my week as a young child, is brilliantly cracked entertainment for me as an adult, and will always hold a special place in my heart, but this DVD release doesn't quite do it justice. The supposed 2005 version mentioned in other reviews has not materialized even now in 2010, but hopefully with Paul Reubens back on stage performing as Pee-Wee, renewed interest in the character will result in the better release it deserves.\n"

aS"\nFirst of all, I just want to say that this watch looks great on the wrist, and it has a decent size. I like all of the features provided on this watch.  First of all, the Altimeter, Barometer, and Compass are amongst the favorite of my features.  The Barometer can be extremely accurate, along with the compass. Sometimes the Altimeter can be off measurement, but you can adjust that.  I've been wearing this watch for several days now and I plan to never take it off.  It just has features that blow every other watch I have in my collection away.  I always use the stopwatch and countdown timers on any digital that I have and this one adds ABC features on top of those as well; world time, atomic time keeping, and solar power, and 100 meter water resistance are all just pluses in an already feature laden time piece.  Not to mention the sunrise and sunset time's feature, which is really useful for maximizing the use of one day.  All in All, I give this watch five stars from a dramatic improvement on Casio's part from the PAW-1300.\n \n Update 6/22/10 *.*.*.*:\n \n As per other reviews, after owning the watch for a couple of months, I agree that the rubber strap is very uncomfortable.  Not so much the strap itself, but the little rubber wings do tend to pull wrist hair.  This watch however, does accept one piece nylon straps (22mm is correct measurement) without strap adapters; just rip off the old rubber strap and wings and replace.  I myself have changed the strap to an old 21mm nylon strap laying around in my drawer and the watch is way more comfortable.  All in all, a very accurate timepiece; with a simple swap of the band, the watch has become more comfortable to wear.\n"

aS'\nI purchased the ViewSonic VX2433WM from a warehouse retailer for an extraordinarily low price, which made it irresistable! \n \n This monitor has vivid, crisp colors and is excellent at displaying graphics and video! By default, it is exceptionally bright, so I adjusted both the contrast and brightness to about 50%. This is a very responsive monitor with no ghosting present. It also came with zero stuck or defective pixels, which made me very happy. \n \n The one area where this monitor could be improved is related to text display. At times, text can be a bit fuzzy on screen, but this is something I\'ve noticed on other 24 inch displays before (notably Samsung). It\'s not a show-stopper, but text is not as clear as on my 19" monitor at home or at work.\n \n The built-in speakers are awful, with a really cheap sound. Fortunately, I don\'t plan to use them much. I think it has to do with function following form where, for beauty\'s sake, the speakers are on the back and downside of the monitor, creating an indirect sound. The sound is much worse than on my old 19" ViewSonic monitor.\n'

aS"\nI just received my book in the mail two days ago and I have been devouring it ever since. \n \n The book begins with seeing Bella become very comfortable with Edward and his family. I was delighted to see Alice's character take on more depth as we began to see more of her personality, but this may quickly turn into disappointment for some, when she is whisked away all too soon. Bella is given a birthday party and accidentally gets a paper cut. This leads to a tense moment when one of the family members cannot contain themselves and makes a leap for Bella. Edward is forced to protect her, but this makes it all to clear that keeping Bella close to the family puts her at risk. Edward begins to withdraw himself emotionally in order to (we readers know what is going to happen, but Bella seems to be in denial)leave her. \n \n Naturally, Bella's grief is heartwrenching to read. Any girl who has felt the pain of lost or unrequited love will shed a few tears during this chapter. It is hard to get over being furious at Edward's behavior at the begining of the book, but this simply shows you how easy it is to get pulled into almost believing these characters are real. \n \n Bella becomes seriously withdrawn from the world after his departure and considering their strange and magical relationship, this is to be expected. I do miss Edward's presence-he was such a strong character in Twilight- but I did something I never do, I flipped to the back of the book to assure myself of his return. Ms. Meyer realizes how addicted her audience is to Edward, so he does make token appearances in a roundabout way. Bella begins to hear Edward's voice warning her when she puts herself in harm's way and in this way Bella begins to court danger.\n \n Jacob, the young native American from Twilight, makes a reappearance in New Moon. He becomes a very close friend of Bella's and helps her through her depression. His character takes the place of Edward and he becomes a major player in this story. He is also the complete opposite of Edward's sophisticated, wordly one. Jacob is lovable, akward, attractive (in a regular way) and warm-blooded. His story is one of interest and I don't believe any reader who has already read Twilight, will be surprised at the turn of events in which Jacob is involved.\n \n The book is certainly excellent, as Ms. Meyer is a fabulous writer, but I do find myself impatiently turning the pages and skimming ahead to see when one of the Cullens' family members will appear. Even with those minor faults, I still find myself staying up way too late to finish another chapter. I have read half the book in the past two days instead of working on lesson plans for my class, during the first week of school, no less. This is a real indicator of just how wonderful New Moon is.\n \n My ultimate disappointment will be when I am finished and must wait another year for the next book to come out. I don't believe Stephenie Meyer can whip these out fast enough to appease her growing leagues of fans. This is a very desirable position to be in for a writer and this should guarantee many Bella and Edward stories in the future.\n \n *Update\n The ending was very good and the reader finds out some interesting information concerning Bella and how special she really is. The twist adds a new dimension to the novel it ends with a bit of a cliffhanger. There is no complete closure for a few important issues and obviously this leaves it wide open for the third novel in the series.\n"

aS'\nAfter our $30 Oral-B AdvancePower 950 TX, Model D9535 died (after only 2 months of use!), we wanted to make sure that our next powered toothbrush would be of higher quality. So my husband heavily researched all current powered toothbrush models and brands and the end result was our purchasing the Sonicare Essence 5300. \n \n This toothbrush is absolutely AMAZING! It deeply cleans your teeth & stimulates your gums so very gently and leaves your mouth feeling like it was just professionally cleaned everytime!! It is such a pleasure to use, that my husband and I have both found that we brush twice as long! The 2 minute timer will shut off the toothbrush, but we will turn it back on and end up brushing until it goes off again. \n \n We opted to get a model without the Quad timer, but I can see how it would be useful, as it would notify you when to go to a new section of your mouth! It is also fairly quiet when operating compared to the Oral-B model we were using. \n \n The overall design of the toothbrush, base and brushhead holder is simple, minimal and clean and does not clutter up your counter too much. The brushhead holder holds 2 replacement heads and works perfectly for couples. Sonicare also color codes their replacement heads, so that when you buy a pack, one will have a grey ring and one a blue ring, so they can be used by 2 different people. Very convenient and helpful!\n \n This toothbrush will leave your mouth very happy and healthy and is definitely worth the money!\n'

aS'\n"If what I say is so outrageous, why don\'t they quote me accurately?"\n - page 80 (Hardback edition)\n \n Since she burst on the political commentary scene in 1996, Ann Coulter has been both adored and hated for her sarcastic conservative comments. With no attempt being made to hide her right-wing bias, she is unashamedly blunt about her views, often coating them in biting repartee. It seems that each time Coulter opens her mouth (or posts another column on her website), the mainstream media screams that she\'s "done it this time!" Yet her books are bestsellers, and she continues to be published. As she points out, if she\'s so over-the-top, why are people continuing to read her work? \n \n In her sixth book, "If Democrats Had Any Brains, They\'d Be Republicans," Ann assembles a collection of her most famous quotes, columns, and interviews on subjects from airport security to taxes, and everything in between. Each chapter contains a brief commentary on the subject, followed by a collection of dated quotes illustrating her beliefs and opinions. \n \n I must admit that, in the past, I have stayed away from political non-fiction. As a conservative Republican, I have found much of it to be in disagreement with my personal views on matters, and I like reading as a way to escape the seriousness of my everyday life. But as I thumbed through a copy of this book at Borders a week ago, I knew I had to read it. Coulter\'s wit and humor make the book a fast read, and her comments are intelligent enough to get you thinking while funny enough to make you laugh. And, while I can\'t say that I agree with her viewpoints on everything, I agree enough to have made this book worth my time.\n \n If you are not a conservative, do not agree with Ann\'s points of view, or are a liberal Democrat, then you probably will not enjoy this book. If, however, you do enjoy reading an intelligent yet witty commentary on the current state of political affairs in the United States (with an admittedly right-wing voice), this book is for you.\n'

aS'\nI recently purchased this mixer because I was questioning whether or not to purchase the much-celebrated Kitchen-Aid Artisan Mixer.  My reasoning: "for far less money, I\'ll purchase this mixer and see how often I really use it, and if it warrants a larger purchase in a year or two."  \n I opened the box and promptly made a batch of cookies which turned out delicious!  Two weeks later I made cupcakes and the batter was COMPLETELY smooth, no lumps and NO handmixing.  I really enjoy that the bowl spins while mixing, the power is substantial, and it is not a large appliance and can be left out on the counter if desired.\n I haven\'t used the dough hooks yet, but plan to make pizza with it soon, perhaps I\'ll add to this review at that time.\n For now, I am completely satisfied with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to occasional bakers who don\'t want to shell out three times as much $$ for something they will only use a few times a year.\n'

aS'\nAs it turns out, Fox has craftily decided to milk "Avatar" for every possibly penny, since the debut DVD/blu-ray will be a bare-bones release -- and it will be one of the first major films to appear in home video without any of the regular special features, such as theatrical trailers, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.\n \n If you want all the extra features, you\'ll have to wait until November, when you can buy a second "Avatar" DVD, currently titled the "Ultimate Edition," which will include all of the fancy stuff. And then, if you have really deep pockets, you can come back to the video store next year and buy a third, 3-D, version of the DVD.\n \n So in a nut shell...

aS'\nI\'ve tracked through this disc a bunch of times now - It just keeps getting better with each listen. It didn\'t take long to realize "Fallen" was going to make its way into my rotation of discs I listen to a lot. I found myself anxiously waiting to hear what came next while listening to it, which rarely happens. Their music is hauntingly dark, and beautiful at the same time, and it does have its "rock" moments, thanks to some really nice guitar sounds. And I *love* Amy\'s voice! The production is huge sounding; the songs are beautifully textured with keyboards, strings and layered back up vocals. This is not a \'rap-metal\' band, if you\'ve only heard the "Bring Me To Life" single. There\'s a lot of depth to this group that you might not be expecting to hear ... and a lot of interesting things going on. Definitely not a "throw on at a party" CD - But one that I find myself wanting to explore beginning to end, again and again. Besides the lead single, I really like "Tourniquet", "Going Under", "Haunted", "My Immortal", "Whisper" and "My Last Breath." The rest of the songs are also very good ... totally worth picking up, and hopefully an indication of more brilliance to come. Awesome stuff - a CD that\'s worth your attention.\n'

So far the pictures I've printed looked great.  No problem with scanning and copying.  It's very quick in handling all my tasks.  Also, one major feature that I love is the built in double sided page printing.  No need for a duplexer! The only thing I don't like is the little panel that comes up on the side.

aS'\nI owned the K1 and then the K2 and love them both, so I was really looking forward to the DX.  My plan was to use the DX at home, and keep my K2 for carrying all over creation with me. It wasn\'t long, though, after my DX arrived the day before yesterday before disappointment set in.\n \n Don\'t get me wrong, there is a LOT to like about the DX:\n \n 1) Pictures are awesome on it, if the publisher formats them properly.\n \n 2) Those who complain about darkness of text on their K2 (a problem I\'ve never had, btw) will be thrilled by the DX\'s very dark text.\n \n 3) The ability to rotate the screen is great.  Gives you a closer look at things like maps and charts.\n \n 4) The browser is a bit faster than on the K1 or K2, though that isn\'t saying much--it is still very clunky to use.\n \n 5) But web pages look pretty good on the DX.\n \n 6) It holds 3500 books.\n \n \n BUT.....the DX just isn\'t all that.  It has drawbacks that are really making me consider sending it back before my 30 days are up:\n \n 1) First and foremost, while it is true that it natively reads PDFs, it is really only a PDF *viewer*.  You can\'t change the font size on PDFs, links will not function on them, and the ability to magnify pictures doesn\'t work on them either. So you better have LARGE fonts on your PDF before you load it.  Looking at the PDF in horizontal mode helps a bit, but not by much.\n \n 2) The DX is too big to hold comfortably.  It\'s not really all that heavy, but it is top heavy and you feel a pull on your hands.  And that pull is really evident if you try to use the keyboard while holding it--you practically have to lay the DX down flat, it becomes so difficult to type.\n \n 3) They merged the number keys with the QWERTY keys (losing a line of keys). What development genius thought it would be helpful and an "improvement" to have to press the ALT key every time you wanted to type a number?!?\n \n 4) Before my DX came, I really didn\'t think this would bother me at all, but I have to say: I really HATE the fact that the "next page" button is only on one side. I mostly use the left hand button. And yes, with the DX\'s rotation ability you can turn it upside down, placing the "next page" button on the left side.... However, when you do this, the button is so high up that you have to slide your hand (not your thumb, your whole hand) up in order to turn the page. May sound nit-picky, but it is truly a PITA to break off reading to do it. Not only that, but having the keyboard at the top makes it even more top-heavy than when it is right side up!\n \n 5) when you rotate the DX so that it is horizontal, the "next page" button is either at the bottom or the top--in either case you can\'t just flick your thumb and change the page. Again, a PITA.\n \n 6)  If you leave the rotation feature on "Auto" when you are not using your DX it drains your battery, so you must remember to turn the feature off when you stop reading.\n \n 7) Still no folders.  An organization nightmare three times bigger than that of the K2 (which itself had increased the same problem on the K1):  the possibility of storing 3500 books but only being able to sort them by author, title, and "most recent first."\n \n \n \n I will be fiercely debating with myself in the next week or so, on whether I really want to keep the DX.  It is so disappointing.  It has the potential of being a really great e-reader...but as it stands now, it isn\'t.  It\'s OK.  But for $489, it should be a lot more than merely OK.\n \n'

aS"\nI use the nono on my upper lip and chin, even though the user manual says not to. In order to get close to upper lip hair without burning my actual lip, I hold a facecloth over my lip with my other hand.\n \n I have had laser hair removal on this area in the past but it is expensive, and it only worked ok, not great. The nono actually works better than laser hair removal did for me. It is easy and fast to use, and less expensive than laser hair removal. I use it about every 3-4 days.\n \n It works good, not great. Works better on my lip than my chin. I have been using it for about 4 weeks and I am seeing a decrease in the amount of hair. I have very sensitive skin so between the nono and the 'buffing' afterward, my skin does feel a little chapped, but not to bad, I put neosporin on the area or that sally hansen 'zero irritation' bikini area cream and that helps too. sometimes I get little papercut like marks if I go over any one area to many times, but they are not so visible. Sometimes it takes a little while for the little bits of hairs to work themselves all the way out from underneath the skin, you can kind of see and feel them in there before the come out, and it might take a little bit of coaxing with squeezing your the skin between your fingers or a tweezer just to guide out the bit of hair. Overall, I am pleased. It is not a miracle cure, but it does work well for me, it's fast, easy and cheaper and works better than using laser hair removal over and over. Plus, you can do it right from home.  I would recommend this product!- Dottie from Massachusetts\n"

aS'\nPeople are finally realizing what I have known for years from watching "Knight Rider." David Hasselhoff can sing! Since the days of "Knight Rider," I thought David should record an album. It wasn\'t until the 1990\'s, during a publicized Pay Per View event that I realized Hasselhoff was doing just that. He had a second career as a singer, over seas! If you can find it, "Looking for Freedom," is an electerically charged album that is a must have for any David Hasselhoff fan. This album is not his best but it is definately above average.  Some of my favorite tracks on the album are: Looking for Freedom Flying on the Wings of Tenderness Lonley is the Night Sheltered Heart  song of the Night Being that Hasselhoff made his mark as a singer over seas. Most of his music is marked as an import and can be hard to find. If you are looking for more music David Hasselhoff Amazon.com is the place to come. without their help I would not have found this album.\n'

aS'\nI think some products like this work differently for some people. My teeth did not have coffee or cig stains so I wasnt trying to remove stains. They just are turning yellow as I age. I did see a difference but it wasnt a dramatic difference. More like a slight improvement. I hope to use the 3rd vial of gel to improve the results soon. I was hoping for a bright white smile I see other people have but I guess that might only be optained by a visit to the dentist. I have tried the colgate brush on gel and the crest strips. I would say this is the best results of the 3 products. It might be more about my teeth than the product though.\n'

aS"\nAfter smash hit Pon de Replay, hit single If It's Loving (which bowed Top 20 in several countries) and a very eclectic dance album Music Of The Sun in her career, Rihanna got herself too much to work on it. Hearing SOS (Rescue Me) is a relief because goes beyond Pon De Replay and give Riha chance to explore on a more underground beat area. The albun which intented give Rihanna a break from reggea and dancehall (which aren't missing but few songs are still influenced by) and give her a step up to R&B area. \n \n Dem Haters and Sean Paul's duo Break It Off prooved to be hit singles when I heard them, good dance beat zone. Rihanna never miss on that but she's got working on do on songs like Crazy Little Thing or Kisses or tittle track which take the album on the ewww zone! Really she could do much better.\n \n R&B area was overwhelming on Unfaithful and PS (Still Not Over You) which are singles prototypes and remixes of If It's and Pon give the album a complement. \n \n Like Music Of The Sun the album tries to get every single rythim available since reggea to R&B to underground dace beat but still have to see that Rihanna is an expert on dance tracks and very cool ballad girl. She must keep on that. Next album she'll do some hard rock if she keeps 'exploring' as record company sais.\n"

aS'\n"The U3 also functions as a flash drive. You can use it to transfer files from one computer or USB device to another."\n \n This is a false claim. The YP-U3 is not a "USB Mass Storage" (UMS) device, and consequently, will not mount on the desktop of Windows or Macintosh computers as a drive. The device requires that you install software (Windows only) to manage the content of the device. Since I bought this with the intention of using it as a flash drive on my Macintosh computer, it\'s now useless in that capacity. I can\'t even use it on the Windows machines at work because it requires the installation of software on any machine you want to use it as a storage device with.\n \n After doing a bit of research on the \'net, I\'ve come to learn that previous generations of this device (U1 and U2) as well as *every other* similar Samsung device had this functionality, with the exception of the U3. Some folks recommend downgrading the ROM to a UMS-compatible version (the ROM download is, in fact, available from Samsung\'s site) but it seems this particular device is \'smart\' and does not allow itself to be modified for UMS functionality.\n \n I\'m sorry to have to rate this product 1 star --  but flash drive functionality was the only reason I bought a 2GB device instead of some other player/recorder/radio with less memory. It\'s actually pretty nice, and I own 2 iPod\'s and an iPhone. The FM radio sounds very good, and the voice recorder is also nice.* The UI is very clever and only a tad more complex to use than an iPod. All around, a nice, tiny, device. Oh, and you can even turn off the LED effects, since out of the box, the default behavior is to flash bright LEDs every time you press a button.\n \n Anyways, with regards to flash drive functionality: Buyer beware!\n \n *With regards the voice recorder, it picks up the noise of your hands when you handle the device. So if you hold it while recording, it will record every squeak and brush of your fingers as it rubs across the surface. Very annoying. Fortunately, it has a clip that will let you tuck the thing in your pocket. So long as you don\'t move much, you won\'t pick up the extra noise.\n'

aS'\nFirst of all, the cable is fine and it\'s a lot better than the other cables that came with WD passports. The old USB cables did have a serious problem with jiggling loose and I could never use them on my laptop if there was any chance the laptop might move even a little for fear of disturbing the cable. I do not have that problem anymore with this passport. \n \n The USB cable is a micro USB cable that is the same as on my BlackBerry 8900. Everyone crying about the "proprietary" cable... get a grip. It\'s not and it fits way more securely than the cable type it replaced. \n \n I\'m favorable to the software too. I want something hardware based that will password protect my drive because I use WD Passports exclusively as portable backup drives that are secondary backups in case of disaster. I own a bunch of them. This also means that I don\'t need to interact with the drive all that often so perhaps if I had to use this drive a dozen times a day and had to deal with the auto-mounting partition, it might get annoying, but it hardly seems like a big deal to me. I don\'t need the backup software on it so I can\'t comment on if that\'s any good at all but it\'s not getting in the way either. I use Apple\'s Time Machine programs to backup directly to this disk at least once a week and it has no conflicts with the permanent backup software on the drive. \n \n As for the drive itself, all I can say is that it\'s so far so good. I\'ve only had mine a few weeks. It\'s worked fine, it\'s fast, it\'s quiet, and it doesn\'t accidentally disconnect all the time like some of my older WD Passports. I normally wouldn\'t write a review so soon as the real test is if the drive is healthy after a few months of real use, but I just couldn\'t believe all the  bellyaching going on here. Until further notice, I wish all of my WD Passports were like this version.\n'

aS"\nJust bought it and have not used all the features yet. So far: sound/reception is very clear (which is what I wanted and what a phone should do). Battery life probably about 4 hours talk time, but too soon for me to be sure. Menu easy to use and can download manual from manufacturer's site. Transfer of media to PC and download very user friendly. Lots of features, though T-Mobile does not support some of them (make sure you check with your provider). The bad so far: not much memory, so you will need a memory card if planning to use the media features, whether video, music, or other. I haven't tested the quality of video and camera. Music speaker is great, considering it is only a phone. Summary: if you are looking for data/office/messaging primarily and the phone is your primary access to the web/e-mail, then this is not the best choice. This phone is a great option for those like me who are wanting an actual real phone with media (i.e. songs, radio, camera, video),internet and e-mail access, don't do tremendous amount of messaging, and everything else is a bonus. It also has a great task/organizer that is very easy to use. By the way, T-mobile has a very nice feature (web2go), which is a limited internet access, also for those who do not use the phone as a primary internet venue but want some internet capability. It is not available with most phones, where you have to buy the whole package (internet and messaging), but it is available with this phone, which makes it very affordable as you do not have to purchase the whole data package in addition to the phone. Also, the phone is just cool. Love when it lits up and the flip design is so much more convenient to hold than the sliders or data phones. Haven't used the radio yet. Hope this helps.\n"

aS'\nAfter having previous LEGO games dished out to us, here comes along "Harry Potter Years 1-4", an exciting achievement that stands out among a basket full of other bland eggs. I was instantly amazed by the beautiful graphics, clever dialogue, and the challenging gameplay. What makes this stand out from other Harry Potter games released in the past is that you have the ability to play as other characters: Ron, Hermione\'s cat, Hagrid, etc. Each character has their own special ability, as well as their own strengths and weaknesses, which adds some flare to the gameplay. What is also new about this addition is that a multiplayer mode has been included for more than just one player. \n \n The premise is fairly simple that most of us are already aware of. It covers years 1-4 from J.K Rowling\'s popular book series based on a teenage wizard. The game moves smoothly over each storyline of the book and stays true to the source material: defeating Aragon from the Chamber of Secrets, all the way to casting the Patronus charm at Dementors in the Prisoner of Azkaban. Gameplay and controls are fairly simple as well and especially fun when you are casting spells with your Wii remote. Many of the challenges involve quick puzzle solving and exploring unknown territory, and can become quite difficult. The crisp graphics combined with the dynamic and elevating score used from the movies also provides us with a clear insight into Harry\'s wizarding LEGO world. \n \n "Harry Potter: Years 1-4" is by the far the finest Harry Potter video game to hit the shelves, possibly the best LEGO game. It gives us a new gameplay experience that we have not yet experienced in a Harry Potter video game and yet still harnesses that ability to captivate us. But, what I love the most about it is that it has allowed me to revisit that childhood I remember as a kid when such things existed. It will certainly keep Harry Potter fans on their feet as well while providing a vivid blast from the past for all of us who enjoyed the previous first four installments. \n \n Jordan Utz, 5 Stars\n'

aS"\nThank you to all my reading friends who suggested The Awakening as one of their favorite classic novels!  I have been trying to branch out into new literary worlds, and the classics is one genre that I hadn't yet touched.  Still a novice, but my journey has been so profitable thus far.  The Awakening was one novel that is incredibly easy to read and holds such powerful prose in so few pages. A taboo subject back in its day, The Awakening tells the story of one woman's emotional journey from a stifled, miserable marriage to a spirited and lusty freedom.  Young Edna Pontellier feels trapped in a loveless, although pampered, life with husband, Leonce.  Stirrings of independence begin one summer while resorting in Grand Isle, an island off the coast of Louisiana.  These new feelings have begun a profound change in Edna, liberating her beyond belief.  Thus ensues an infidelity that dreams are made of, although at the expense of her marriage and motherhood. Hardly shocking in this day and age, The Awakening's subject of marital infidelity and physical lust for another is always a pageturner.  The theme of the novel -- Edna's torment at the chains that bind her and the flutterings of an unbridled passion -- is brought to life with beautiful writing in simple, elegant words.  I am surprised to find such a passionate and provocative story within its pages.  Short but penetrating, The Awakening will move you.\n"

aS"\nI returned the Swing and Lock gates and got this one. I am not disappointed. It was worth the additional cost. It comes with its own tool, which fastens the pressure mounts securely. I did not need an extension, so I cannot comment on how sturdy it is using those.It is very easy  to open and close, and the gate swings in both directions. It was also easy to install. I have no complaints. I can't believe how many people report bad experienced using these on stairs. If you read the directions, it is NOT to be used on stairs. If your child gets hurt, you have nobody else to blame but yourself! This gate is NOT for everyone. The opening is only 18&quot; wide, so this would not be for a home with a wheelchair. Although it installs easily, I wouldn't suggest this one if you plan on moving it from doorway to doorway on a regular basis. It takes a few minutes, not something I'd want to do all day. But it is very easy to move, such as if you where having a party or needed to move furniture. This gate is well made, but I do have one concern about durability. It has a plastic pin that locks the swinging part into place. I wonder if someone who does not push the pedal enough and pushes the gate, probably an unfamiliar adult or older child, could break it. I haven't seen anything to that affect in other reviews, so maybe not. Still, I'd have prefered to see metal. Maybe that concern is unfounded, I guess we'll see. Buy this gate.\n"

aS"\nThis is a beautifully written and illustrated story for children. It's an inspirational story of self-discovery that also imparts our American values of pursuing one's dreams with hard work and perseverance.  I'm a Republican and don't support/like Obama, but this is a great book because it tells a story my kids enjoy about another human being who has made something of his life. (I only wish the McCain book was as well written). I highly recommend this and Winter's other children's biographies if you want your children to enjoy learning about about history and culture through truly inspirational life stories.\n"

aS'\nI LOVE THIS STUFF !!!\n Its got a great lemon smell and it spreads easily, like baby oil. It\'s not greasy like "skin so soft" and it\'s natural. I never did like the smell of DEET and I always wondered what the unnatural chemicals were doing to my skin.\n \n The most important thing is IT WORKS !!!  Even after 100s of ticks are crawling and biting, one squirt and they die. I use one squirt per ear and mosquitoes stay away from my head. I oil up my arms and legs then I head off in to the bush without fear of bug bites. I spray it on any scratches because I have found that it makes a great disinfectant and wound dressing with very little sting. It\'s a must for any med kit.\n \n Warning: if you get it in your eyes it will sting for a few seconds until your tears dilutes the oils. It\'s flavor is NOT lemony.\n \n I\'m 38 and I love being, and working, in the woods and brush. This is the best repellent I have found. I\'m glad Amazon has it. \n \n \n'

aS'\nComprehensive, detailed and surprisingly easy to read, this biography of Hillary Clinton should be read by anyone who has a vote in any of the upcoming Democratic primaries and, if she wins that party\'s nomination, anyone planning to vote in 2008. Sure, many people claim to already know all they need to about Mrs. Clinton, but reading this book you really start to understand her. And whether you love her or hate her, your opinion just might be changed.\n \n An amazingly interesting book, "A Woman in Charge" is divided into three sections. The first 70 pages cover Clinton\'s childhood in Chicago and college years. The next 100 recount her years in Arkansas. The remaining 350 focus on Hillary\'s experience as First Lady, with just a few devoted to her time as a senator.\n \n From a young child\'s love of earning Girl Scout merit badges, to a 14-year-old Goldwater Girl\'s trip to see Martin Luther King, to a modern senator\'s remarkably unique reason for voting for authorized force against Iraq (she said it would make "war less likely"), there\'s never a dull moment. And thanks to interviews with more than 200 Clinton associates and more than 500 footnotes, every sentence rings true.\n \n The book doesn\'t offer any juicy gossip, but does have lots of intimate behind-the-scenes detail. Hillary\'s first college boyfriend supplies Bernstein with the letters she wrote to him (what a jerk!), in which the 18-year-old freshman describes herself as "a progressive, an ethical Christian and a political activist" who is nevertheless "outrageous... as outrageous as a moral Methodist can get." Later on, Bernstein reveals that Bill Clinton asked Hillary to marry him many times before she finally said yes, and that once in Arkansas he told her he had fallen in love with another woman and wanted a divorce, which she refused. Toward the end of the book, the author recounts a moment during the peak of the Lewinsky crisis, when Stevie Wonder met Hillary at a White House dinner and insisted on taking her to a private room to perform a song he had written for her -- about forgiveness. \n \n What impressed me most about "A Woman in Charge" is how well it is written. Though every chapter is meticulously well documented, each explains its often-complex story in a clear and engaging style. You can picture yourself in the Yale dorm room when, in 1968, the politically active junior hears of Martin Luther King\'s assassination and pounds the wall, screaming "I can\'t stand it anymore! I can\'t take it!" And you can\'t help but cringe when you read of Hillary\'s first meeting with Virginia Cassidy Blythe Clinton Dwire -- Bill\'s mom -- after the charismatic woman with the "white-striped hair and fondness for fast men, fast horses, red lipstick and false eyelashes" had driven up to New Haven from Arkansas in 1972: "Virginia thought Hillary was a fright," Bernstein writes, "her hair badly cut (she had chopped it herself that semester, to save money), no makeup, and jeans, her preferred posture tending toward a hippie slouch."\n \n Equally compelling are the White House chapters, as Bernstein explains how Hillary\'s own overzealous promotion of her 1993 health-care plan ironically caused it to fail, but how her similar devotion to defending Bill against impeachment charges caused that fight to succeed.\n \n "A Woman in Charge" includes eight pages of black-and-white photos, mostly from Clinton\'s years as First Lady. Under the book jacket is a plain gray cover. \n \n All in all, what emerges is a sympathetic portrait of an extremely bright and talented American woman who has overcome a lot to get where she is -- but can nevertheless be cold, calculating and, worst of all, sometimes completely clueless on how to get things done. Bernstein shows how Hillary has learned from many of her mistakes and excelled in the Senate, but in the process has formed such a "protective shell" around her true character that she may, or may not, have what it takes to win the nomination, get elected, and be a great President.\n'

Although I could not find the audio jumper configuration in the motherboard to choose between AC'97 and HD audio, I believe there was no need for it since the manual said HD audio was the default configuration and you would obviously prefer HD audio.  Overall, very good price for a very good motherboard.  Great for a mid-end system.\n"

aS'\nWell Despite all the reviews, I decided to order the Archos 5 160GB version. I was a little worried about what I would encounter, however there worries would soon transition from worried to eased.\n \n The make of this device is very solid and it is a little big for the pocket, but it\'s manageable. This device would be significantly useful for people on the go as it allows you to bring a large amount of media with you all in a neat little tablet that can handle HD output (Given some videos are going to be laggy, but this is normal for most hand held devices as they do not have the rendering capabilities that of a computer does). However to deal with this, Archos is trying to maintain regular updates. Just recently they released 2 updates for the Archos 5. If you go to the main Archos site, which is at [...] you can look at the updates that have been released for the device. It turns out that with each update they are trying to clean up the HD output given the limitations of the hardware also they are working on another update which is called doughnut, which is version 1.6 android, I believe (which will hopefully include the android market!! :)). This device also has a TON of space.\n \n With all this space it can have other uses as well. I, Personally, have a large collection of books and music, I used this device as a backup of all my files so that in the event that anything happens to my main machine, I will always have the files I prioritized. Another neat little thing that the Archos 5 can do is it can read PDFs and Office Files, which is nice if you ever have to edit your office files on the go.  With the amount of area that is displayed by the screen, it allows for a very nice and ease of reading. At times I can find myself reading a book on it and reading it with ease with the large screen, as well as the capabilities of the software to handle PDFs. One thing to be noted by this is the fact that due to the hardware constraint, it will have to load each page after you read about half of your current page and half of the next page in order to have it load the next page. This is done to save space and maintain its longevity due to its hardware constraints. However, the transitions is very fast, shouldn\'t be a pain, although a very minor annoyance. One thing I should note is that some people have claimed that some videos are not able to play, although I have yet to encounter this issue.\n \n I feel that I got a huge bargain on this device. Given its updates and overall capabilities as not only an internet tablet but also its media playback along with its touchscreen capabilities (which is acceptable, in practicality -- Make sure that you configure the touchscreen when it seems to not be functioning properly) it almost feels like a steal. To sum up the review I\'m going to make a list of pros and cons.\n \n Pros\n \n Large beautiful screen\n Touch Screen\n Variety of Media playback capabilities\n Made with Android OS (very stable)\n Can be used as a PDF Reader as well as do MORE\n Has GPS capabilities\n Lots of applications -- AppsLib (And much more will come when android market is finally released -- although there is a way to get market on it with a little trick-- but it does not include all the times that are in the CURRENT market, its a makeshift to get it to work AND Google applications be installed using this little trick, Google "Android Market on Archos 5 Internet Tablet")\n Lasts a good amount of time\n Easy to use\n \n ------------------------\n \n Cons\n \n No android 2.0 (yet..?)\n Charging is somewhat slow (it will lose charge [when plugged in via DC-IN USB to MiniUSB] when transferring files to it, do it in chunks to deal with this issue, although you\'ll still lose battery life)\n Somewhat laggy Video playback (should be remedied somewhat with updates)\n Locks up sometimes (this was in the past, however with the new update they released I haven\'t seen it happen..yet?)\n LONG start up time (use standby)\n \n I hope this review helps you guys decide on buying one :)\n \n'

I first thought this show would be awful, but I sat down and watched it--and it was love.  Truly.  It\'s rare to find a show that can be taken seriously that also made me laugh out loud in every episode.  The writing was extraordinary, and the actors/actresses were absolute gold.  It was really like watching a movie each time around.  Yet again, Fox shot itself in the foot and iced another good show.  Nonetheless, at least the DVD is soon to come.  At least they had the decency to do that.  Come on, sing it with me: "Take my love, take my land, take me where I cannot stand.  But I don\'t care--I\'m still free.

aS'\nI was really hesitant to buy this phone due to the conflicting reviews I read from various sources.  I wanted to replace my Samsung Eternity, which I really loved, but as time went on I found that not having voice dial was a real annoyance, making my blue tooth headset virtually useless.  Then again, I didn\'t like the idea of giving up a speedier interface. I made my decision. After getting the Mythic, I\'m happy to announce that all my reservations were put to rest.  This phone is everything the Eternity was, except that everything I felt that needed improvement was realized in the Mythic. No regrets here! My major complaint is that Samsung\'s New PC Studio no longer provides support for backing up your address book, or your calendar events. I\'m sure this has more than a little to do with at&t\'s desire to charge you $3.00 per month to do this for you (address book only).  You may want to think twice about filling up the 2000 entry capable contact list on the Mythic.  If fact, the biggest problem with this phone is that just about every application it offers will suck you dry with a monthly fee, as opposed to a one-time purchase for it. Even Mobile Email with cost you $5.00 per month now. I guess we\'re just not paying enough for cell phone service these days.  If you want your Outlook Express email on your phone, get a Gmail account with Google, set up their IMAP server, and you can link up with your email and make it look like you\'re sending and receiving from your Outlook account. Once you\'re all set up, simply import your contacts from Outlook Express to Gmail, then bookmark Google\'s link to their Gmail into your phone\'s browser, or download their Gmail app to your phone for free. All your contacts from Outlook will be available either way. UPDATE: After reading a post by E. McGlynn, I can confirm that "New PC Studio version 1.2.1 IH1" will allow you to back up your contacts and calendar events. Why this version isn\'t packaged with the Mythic is beyond me, except for maybe the reasons stated above. Thank you, E. McGlynn, so much for your valuable post. Here are some of my impressions of the Mythic:\n \n The Interface - Yes, the interface isn\'t as snappy as it is on the Eternity, but you will forget about this when you see the gorgeous 3.3", 360x640 pixel screen.  I\'m guessing this has something to do with the sluggishness, due to the increased amount of picture data that has to be switched around to form a new screen, or change from landscape to portrait mode. If this is so, it\'s a worthwhile trade-off. The print on web pages is so sharp; I don\'t need to zoom in to read the smallest. If you\'re switching from a phone like the Eternity to the Mythic, you just need to learn to relax and slow down a bit when touching your way around the screen.\n \n The Touch Screen - There is definitely a learning curve with the touch screen.  At first I thought there were times it was unresponsive, and sometimes it still does seem to be, but after a little experience with the phone, these "unresponsive times" are few and far between. The screen is not only sensitive to touch, but also to how long you touch it for. This is necessary so you\'re not always moving widgets all over the place every time you swipe the screen. When using the browsers (there are two), a prolonged touch will give you more options on the screen. If you\'re somewhere in between with your touch, I feel that this can sometimes confuse the software as to what your intent is, so it does nothing. So you need to practice.  Whether you\'re on the home screens, or the menu screens, there are 3 horizontal dashes, side by side, at the top of the screen. When on home screen 1 (or menu screen 1), the first dash highlights. Screen 2, the second dash highlights, etc.. When swiping your finger across the screen to change it, it\'s very easy to activate the widgets, causing great frustration. Swipe too hard, you activate the widgets, too soft, the screen doesn\'t move. Solution: swipe your finger or thumb across those dashes at the top of the screen. This works so well, it leads me to believe that this was Samsung\'s intent.  It only takes the slightest pressure to move the screens, first time, every time!\n \n The Virtual Keyboard - I love this keyboard. As much as I liked the Eternity\'s, this one is better.  The keys are offset like a computer keyboard, as opposed to block style, and there are spaces between the keys. The keyboard is plenty roomy enough, and I make much fewer mistakes on it than my previous phone.  I can move right along on it with no lag.  When changing the keyboard from portrait mode to landscape mode, there is more lag time than I\'m used to on the Eternity, but guess what....I compared it to my nephew\'s iPhone, and the lag time is the same.  Texting is a breeze with this phone. If you\'re in a hurry and need to type super fast, keep the T9 on.  It will work like an auto-correct feature.\n \n The Camera and Video - Sorry to say, the Eternity, at 3 mpix, no auto-focus and no flash, takes better pictures under more conditions than the 3.2 mpix Mythic WITH auto-focus and a flash. In fact, I\'m finding that the auto-focus is just a time consuming farce. I\'ve been taking identical pictures using the auto-focus, and then just taking the picture without waiting, and there is no difference. If I crop a picture, I find that sometimes the result is clearer WITHOUT the auto-focus. Nice try, Samsung.  There were times when my Eternity, under best conditions, took pictures that rivaled those taken with my camera. The pictures on the Mythic can at times be very good, but mostly they are a little fuzzy.  Subjects at the edges of the pictures will suffer a little with barrel distortion, but I\'ve found this true with any camera-phone I\'ve owned. Any movement by your subject will show up as a blur in the photo. Under very dark lighting conditions, the Mythic wins over the Eternity, due to its flash, but the pictures will be grainy and the colors will be distorted and washed out. Having said all this, many people will find the pictures to be very good, and in all fairness, they are better than on some popular smart phones I\'ve seen that have 5 mpix.  The video recorder on the phone is just adequate. Along with two resolution choices, there are three viewing modes: Small (picture box), Medium (fills screen top to bottom), and Distorted (fills screen left to right). This last mode is horribly pixilated with choppy motion. You choose the mode with the little box in the upper left with the circle in the middle and the arrows radiating out towards the four corners. Oddly enough, the playback of the videos defaults to the worst viewing mode. UPDATE: The default viewing mode for video playback can be changed during the playback of a video. Simply touch the edit icon (the lined page on top of the horizontal pencil)at the bottom-left of the screen, and you\'ll see the "Display Mode" button. Touch this and choose your new default viewing mode.\n \n The Internet - There are two browsers on this phone. There\'s the Mobile Web, which at&t seems to promote with its dedicated widget, and then there\'s simply "Browser" over in applications.  Mobile Web is powered by Opera Mini.  You must choose your viewing mode, landscape or portrait, mobile or HTML. You do this in "settings". This browser does a very nice job rendering web pages.  It\'s also the more finicky one when it comes to touch. At first I was touching links three or four times to activate them. You really need to get the hang of it.  Once you do, you\'ll find it\'s very responsive with the quickest and lightest of touches.  The other browser is the old, familiar one I had on the Eternity. It automatically changes from landscape to portrait, but chooses how the page will load best. This is the browser that the Facebook widget uses.  Sometimes the Facebook page loads extra tiny for some unexplained reason. When this happens, the screen can respond strangely when you try to navigate.  It will seem to freeze, but then "catch up" and start moving on it own. Luckily, this happens only sporadically. This browser also allows you open multiple web pages at one time, for tabbed browsing. Also, any links you bookmark with this browser are stored in the "Favorites" widget on the widget tool bar.  Both browsers have their advantages and do a good job. One may render the same page better than the other.  The "Browser" may be better for quickly checking things like weather, sports, etc.  The Mobile Web is probably better for surfing content rich websites. It\'s strictly a personal preference. They both have their own personalities, and I use both equally. \n \n Voice Commands - This is a great feature for some people. I am a carrier for the U.S.P.S.   At certain times during the year, my phone is under 3 or 4 layers of clothes. Two layers cover my head.  I don\'t have time to stop and make phones calls, but if I did, reaching for my phone under those layers with a gloved hand is an invitation to send the phone tumbling to the asphalt.  With voice commands, problem solved!  Even with my bluetooth headset under my headwear, people have no trouble hearing me and I have no problem hearing them. At the touch of the button on my bluetooth, I can check time, date, go to voicemail, call the Post Office with a problem, check the phone\'s battery, signal strength, or whether I really did feel my phone vibrate with a new message, and more, all while leaving my phone safely in its holster under all my clothes. This is invaluable for me, though probably not for everyone.\n \n The Battery - The battery life is excellent for a phone with such power hungry features.  My phone is turned on at 5:30am, and shuts off at 10:30pm. If I use the phone only when needed, there will be at least 4 out of 5 bars at the end of the day, sometimes 5. If I\'m out and about on a day off, constantly texting, checking Facebook, surfing the web and playing with features that keep the phone backlit constantly, I MAY drain the battery by the end of the day. Most of the time there are one or two bars left.  As I\'ve found with most digital volume indicators, the last two thirds of the increments disappear as fast as the first third. They simply aren\'t linear. So if you use 2 out of 5 increments the first day, don\'t think your phone will last another day and a half of the same usage. It may not make it till the end of the second day.\n \n This phone has been great for me thus far.  I\'m finding that most of the things a smart phone can do, are things I\'m never going to need on a regular basis anyways.  They aren\'t things that can justify an extra $15 per month out of my pocket.  This phone comes close to a smart phone.  Very close.\n \n \n'

aS'\nI am writing this review, because every review on here seems to be about the author and his biases and not about the BOOK itself. Let me first say that I am an avid reader. I read everything from Stephenie Meyer to Bertrand Russell, Chuck Palahniuk to Freakonomics.  I read 3-5 books per week, fiction and non-fiction alike. \n \n I knew very little about Glenn Beck before I purchased this book. Of course I had heard his name, and that he was a radio personality, but that\'s about it. I read a little about him before beginning the book, learning that he is a "conservative libertarian."  With that being said, it didn\'t really matter to me, a good book is a good book, no matter the political implications or insinuations. \n \n About the book: The plot was weak, it could have used a lot less quoting and preaching and a lot more character development and background. I found myself being thrown into a whole lot of speeches and little narrative or story development.\n \n The original character descriptions were good, but I found myself wanting to know more about them, who they were really, where they came from, and what they were thinking. The protagonist of this story was the only character that was explored deeper than a name, physical description, and a little about their backgrounds. I wanted to know more about them ESPECIALLY what they were thinking. \n \n The writing was a little below average. Mr. Beck just isn\'t that good of a story teller, I found myself drifting through the quotes and preaching, wanting them to be over so the story could continue...which it never really did. There was never a climax in the story, and the ending left a lot to be desired. \n \n You would have expected to learn a lot more of the elder Mr. Gardner(the main character\'s father) before the last chapter. Additionally, I felt that it ended without anything being solved. It just kind of ended in what I would think of as the middle of the story. \n \n All in all this was not worth the day and a half I put into reading it, and I suggest if Mr. Beck wants to share his political ideology, he stick to non-fiction. I would be happy to read it, and would probably enjoy it.\n \n Why write a fiction book, when really all you want to do is write a book of facts regarding the corruption of our country? That\'s what we really need to hear and read...hiding all of that in the guise of a fiction story(dubbed a thriller, no less) is disappointing to those of us who want to read a good novel.  \n \n ***NOTE: For all of you who are going to call me a biased liberal hippie, I am a former employee and lifetime member of the National Rifle Association(thanks to Mr. Beck for the kudos in the book), and a member of the libertarian party. \n \n \n'

aS'\nI actually could not decide between the Garmin Nuvi 255w or the 750 model, so I decided to buy them both for comparison. I mounted them both to my car windshield and gave them various addresses to find together. I found that both models took the same routes and announced upcoming turns and street names at practically the same time. One thing I noticed about the 255w was that it was updating my position on the road more often, I\'d say about 3 times as often as the 750. This made for smoother graphics on the 255w of the vehicle moving along displayed roads, where the 750\'s display was more of a "jerky" movement. I also found that the display on the 255w was a bit brighter, clearer, and more vivid than on the 750 in both daylight and at night.  Another feature I like on the 255w is the graphic turn indicator in the upper left corner, which the 750 lacks. This is a small arrow which shows upcoming turns and the distance to that turn. It also show things like a fork in the road, (ie: a Y intersection), and which fork you will be taking. The 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the arrow. It\'s just a little extra feature on the 255w which I happened to really like. The 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit.\n Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed. I found myself not even looking at my car speedometer as I could easily see my current speed and the speed limit of my route at a glance. The 750 doesn\'t have this feature. I also like how they moved the zoom in (+) and zoom out (-) buttons on the 255w to the same side of the screen which makes it a bit easier. On the 750 the zoom buttons are on opposite sides of the screen.\n Now there are some features on the 750 that the 255w does not have. The 750 can broadcast it\'s sound over your FM radio with the supplied cigarette lighter cable, and it has a headphone jack, which I found to be nice features. The 750 also has an MP3 player and an Audio-book player, which the 255w does not. Another really nice feature of the 750 is the car locater. This is a great feature if you are parking in a really big lot, such as at an amusement park or a fair. The 750 marks your location when you remove it from the car, then you take it with you and it remembers where you parked and takes you right back to your car. The 255w doesn\'t have the car locater. \n I also thought the the voice prompts of the 750 where more pleasant sounding than the 255w\'s. The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic.\n Another thing to consider was that I paid $50 less for the 750 and it came with the FM transmitter cable and a USB cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads.\n My final decision was to keep the 255w and return the 750 because I really liked the graphic turn indicator and the posted speed limit and current speed indicators. I didn\'t find a need for the 750\'s MP3 player and Audio book player, but that is up to personal preference. Since the USB cable was not included with the 255w, I purchased it on this site for $10. I also intend to purchase the MSN direct cable when it is available in August 2008.\n'

aS"\n17 APR 2010\n \n After researching the `cornucopia' of compressors on the market and concluding my own specific needs for such, I decided to purchase this compressor.  Good call on my part.\n \n After following CH instructions on pre-operation setup, this compressor has performed very well.  Within the first 24-hours of receiving it, I used it to add air to vehicle and ATV tires to cleaning the air filter and deck on my mower, to blowing off steps prior to painting.\n \n While the coiled air hose takes a little time to get accustomed to, I consider it a minor inconvenience.  As many have reported, one may consider the noise level extreme.  While you can expect noise from any such device, this inconvenience is limited to only when the device is charging.\n   \n The portability is a nice added bonus.  If you must use an extension cord, make sure the cord is properly rated to the amps and watts of the device.  Otherwise, circuit breakers can trip and the device will not work as designed. The use of household-type light duty extension cords may lead to electrical shock hazard, increased fire hazard, and damage to your new compressor.  When in doubt, consult with a licensed electrician.\n \n Overall, I rate the compressor 5 stars. It beats driving to a service station and throwing away [...] for three minutes of air time. Assuming you can find a service station with a working air hose!\n \n Mike\n [...]\n"

aS'\nThese diapers are PERFECT as burp cloths and mini-towels.  We used them as burp cloths when our daughter was an infant, and we continue to use them to wipe messy faces after meals, as well as to wipe runny noses during teething.  We keep them all over the house!  Be careful though - there are two types, one with padding and one without - make sure to get the ones without, as the ones with extra padding are useless in this capacity.

aS'\nThis calm, straightforward book reminds me why I have a "Women for Obama" bumper sticker on my truck. It\'s short on rhetoric, long on clear-headed, specific ideas on how to fix America\'s problems. In back are seven key speeches from this long presidential campaign, speeches so beautifully written they read like poetry. Any voter wanting to know more about who Barack Obama is and what he stands for should read this book.\n \n In essence, it\'s a glimpse into what Obama will do as president, why these actions are smart, and how he\'ll get the plan done. It\'s like a presidential crystal ball, letting readers know what they\'re voting for -- or against.\n \n Change We Can Believe In was put together by Obama for America, with a foreword by the candidate. Net proceeds from book sales will be donated to charity.\n \n The speeches soar. The "race" speech Obama gave in Philadelphia is striking in its honesty: it is from a leader, not a politician. From the New Hampshire Primary Night speech: "And so tomorrow, as we take this campaign south and west, as we learn that the struggles of the textile worker in Spartanburg are not so different than the plight of the dishwasher in Las Vegas; that the hopes of the little girl who goes to a crumbling school in Dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of L.A.; we will remember that there is something happening in America: that we are not as divided as our politics suggests; that we are one people; we are one nation; and together, we will begin the next great chapter in America\'s story with three words that will ring from coast to coast; from sea to shining sea. Yes. We. Can."\n \n Here\'s the chapter list:\n \n Foreword by Barack Obama\n \n Part One: The Plan\n \n Introduction: Hope for America\n \n 1. Reviving Our Economy: Strengthening the Middle Class\n * Provide immediate relief with an emergency economic plan\n * Economic security and opportunity for all American families\n * Affordable health care for all Americans\n * Empower families to succeed\n * Restore trust, return to fiscal responsibility\n \n 2. Investing In Our Prosperity: Creating our Economic Future\n * Promote our energy independence and create five million green jobs\n * A world-class education for every American\n * Make America the undisputed leader in science and technology\n * Build the infrastructure of the twenty-first century\n * Help our small businesses and manufacturers thrive and create jobs\n * Compete and thrive in the global economy\n \n 3.

aS"\nMy mother bequeathed her 1962 college edition hardcover to me in 1988, four years after I finished high school. It would be four more years before I myself went away to school, though I knew the story nearly by heart by then. \n \n I reread Mockingbird every year at Eastertime, though I am not particularly religious, nor do I mark this time in any other particularly hopeful way. Many true bibliophiles I know still talk about this book and the way it changed them forever.\n \n It deserves better than to be assigned reading to captive 6th and 10th graders. They read it then because they have to, not because some kind librarian or insightful teacher, or intuitive parent, sends it their way, like a lucky charm.\n \n I am not a Southerner and unless you can call a Western New York born mother and an Owensboro, Kentucky bred father any sort of meaningful Southern influence in my life, I do not know why this story fits my life so well. It filled a need I never even knew was there until I closed its covers on first reading it. \n \n I am a fan of both the writing and its message, its dual edged sword of hope and sorrow, the tragicomic aspect of its mood and setting. \n \n I wanted to be Scout as a tomboy girl and when grown, to be Atticus; my cats have borne those monikers well. \n \n I only wish my husband had not told me I could not name my own son after my hero. \n \n A rare case where the movie and its inspiration are as beloved as its author, To Kill a Mockingbird, N words and all, needs to be read more---and not just as some lame excuse for a paper writing exercise. Scout, Jem and Dill come alive in these pages. They have meaning in their world and in this one.\n \n The dialogue, minus a few colloquiallisms, is readable and real. You will laugh out loud at times when Scout makes her mind known to you.\n \n You'll wish Atticus was a real man. Maybe you'll even feel a little guilty about wanting him to replace your father in real life.\n \n And Tom Robinson? He'll break your heart. He should.\n \n I was once told my Coleman family had some relation to Harper Lee's father's family and, if that bit of fiction has even the remotest grain of truth to it, I am even happier now than I was just having imagined it. \n \n PLEASE READ THIS BOOK.\n \n"

aS"\nI literally got this book hot off the press; the minute I could get it.  And it was well worth it to me.  I was first of all surprised at how up to date it is.  I was afraid it might be a rehash of old shows, and it definitely is not.  I found out things about the housewives that made a lot of the things that happen on the show make better sense.  I so enjoyed this book, that I would love to see one put out every couple of years, to update things and tell about new wives.  At the price it is, you can't buy 4 or 5  fan magazines for the price of this book.  If you watch Housewives zealously as I do, you won't want to be without this book.\n"

aS'\nThe revolution I refer to is the one that followed in the wake of the original publication of this book in 1961. Ellis formally introduced his REBT therapeutic model in 1955, but at the time, few knew and fewer cared. However, this book would change that forever. No longer would we have to settle for self-help pablum like "The Power of Positive Thinking", because now we had a piercing book for the masses that explained both clearly and thoroughly three things that no popular work had ever told us before. First, we don\'t just "get" upset, we "do" upset. Or, in other words, we make ourselves emotionally disturbed. Second, the authors plainly explain how we make ourselves upset. We create our own emotional disturbances mainly through our irrational (aka, unhealthy, self-defeating) thinking. And third, Ellis and Harper give us many effective techniques to combat these thinking patterns. The techniques suggested are divided into cognitive, emotive and behavioral categories, although in fact there is significant overlap for the simple reason, as the authors point out, that we don\'t just think or feel or behave in a vacuum. Rather, we are thinking/feeling/behaving beings, and this interplay, luckily enough, offers us many ways to a "profound philosophic change" in our outlook, which is the goal of this work. Easily, the most influential self-help book ever written and rightfully so!\n'

aS"\nSpaceballs is perhaps the best Sci-fi spoof of all time. It has already been mentioned that it spoofs Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, but it really spoofs nearly every big Sci-fi movie ever. Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey (&quot;...they've gone to plaid!&quot;) and many more. Some of the best sequences are the &quot;ludicruous speed&quot; scene, the &quot;instant video&quot; scene, and the whole Yogurt part. Mel Brooks plays the spoof of Star Wars' Yoda who is the guardian of the Schwartz and is also heavily into Spaceballs Merchandising, including the Spaceballs flamethrower. (&quot;The kids love this one.&quot;) Rick Moranis, of course, is the Darth Vader spoof, and I have to congradulate the casting department, because Rick Moranis and Darth Vader have to be as close to being polar opposites as you can come. Although I have heard it called unfunny and lame by others, I think it is a very funny movie and deserves to be watched not only by Sci-fi fans, but by anybody looking for a good laugh.\n"

aS'\nThis is my 2nd Eco-Drive Watch. Eco-Drive is by far my favorite watch brand.  My other Eco-Drive is a moon-phase Calibre that I wear to work everyday.  I wanted another watch that was less dressy, and was happy when I found this watch at a low price.  However, this watch looks very nice, despite its price.  Some reviewers don\'t like the watchband.  I agree that a leather band would make it look more expensive, but this is a military watch and the band is quite appropriate. Although the description calls this a canvas strap, the inside is coated so that it does not absorb sweat. Also, I have small wrists and Eco-Drives are the only watches that I can wear without modifying the strap.  It\'s VERY easy to set.  It is more like a traditional watch; you only need to adjust the main crown.  The other two buttons north and south of the crown control the chronograph.  Seconds tick by on this watch on the small dial located just above the "6" on the watch face. The large second hand that you normally associate with the sweep second hand is part of the chronograph.  By the way, the chronograph is EXTREMELY easy to operate.  One of my favorite features of this watch are the extremely large, easy-to-read numbers on the dial.  Only downside is that the three small dials on the face are smaller and more difficult to read, but I think that is an unavoidable consequence of the design.  Overall, this is a great watch!!\n'

aS"\nMy guitar was beautiful. The laquer finish was flawless. The fret board and bridge are excellent quality and dark. The construction and seems were excellent. The neck and set-up were excellent for a guitar at this price. The tone is very distinctive. You may wish to upgrade the gig bag and strap. Use the new strap attacher that allows the strap to be attached and removed easily for storage in a case. Don't add a button at heel - unbalances guitar and you risk the finish.\n The instructional C.D. is fun and inspiring. Esteban really encourages you to aprreciate your instrument and the sound of it. As a bonus, Instructional C.D. 1 includes Esteban in concert - wow! And to top it off, besides the instructional C.D.s and chord chart it includes his Into the Heart C.D. - great for in the car or at home. Esteban is truly a master of the guitar. He teaches with the guitar you are purchasing so you hear how it sounds when tuned and played correctly! I'm ordering the rarer White burst. It is getting harder to find a Gift of Guitar package with the natural spruce top or the white burst - so grab one if you get a chance. At this price there isn't too much that compares for how much you get.\n"

aS"\nI received a white one for an early christmas gift and just used it for the first time on he christmas cookies that are a tradition in my family.  In the past years, I've used my mother's old stand-mixer, and I've also used a hand mixer, which is near impossible to do with this recipe.  This year, I used my new mixer and I am blown away!  These cookies, that usually take forever, were done in no time!  And even though I didn't think the 4 1/2 quart bowl would be big enough for the whole recipe, I had no problem and room to spare!  It's surprisingly deep.  It also stayed relatively cool through the three batches of cookies I made (I'm used to beginning to smell smoke from my mothers!) I only used the flat beater yesterday, but have some bread recpies that I'm dying to use the dough hook on.   Just a few concerns...The dough sticks to the side of the bowl, so I did have to stop from time to time and scrape it off, but that was nothing that I wasn't used to.  And you cannot attach a larger bowl to this mixer...the only other bowl you can attach is one of the same size with a handle.   And definately invest in a splash guard.  You only get lemon extract in your eyes once to make that decision.\n"

aS'\nEDIT: An updated and revised review of this laptop can be found at over at Expert Laptop Review: [...]\n \n I recently went on a laptop buying rampage and have ended up with the Dell Studio 14z, HP dm3z (L625 + Radeon 4330), and the Asus UL80VT-A1 in possession all at once. The first part of this review will focus solely on the Asus UL80VT-A1 and the second part of this review will compare it with my experience with the Dell Studio 14z and the HP dm3z. \n \n ASUS UL80VT-A1 DETAILED REVIEW\n \n First and foremost, let me say that I ordered the UL80VT-A1 because I thought it was simply an awesome idea to have switchable graphics in a laptop because you get excellent battery life + excellent performance when needed. There were no reviews of the UL80VT out when I purchased it, so I purchased the UL80VT-A1 from [...], which has a 100 percent refund on purchases just in case things didn\'t work out with me and the new lady. \n \n While I was waiting to recieve the laptop in the mail, I read a review over at [...]. Oh boy, was I disappointed considering all the bad things the reviewer had to say about it (i.e. bad keyboard, bad track pad, horrible build quality, poor gaming performance). Needless to say, I had second thoughts about even opening up the Asus UL80VT-A1 because I didn\'t think it was worth my time considering the all the problems the reviewer had with his review model. \n \n So that morning I got my HP dm3z in the mail and was really excited about how incredibly beautiful the laptop was. It is definitely sexier (in my opinion) than every other ultraportable out there, including the Macbook Pro 13" and HP Envy 13. I\'ll get to the dm3z a little later... either way, my first impression led me to believe that I\'d probably be keeping the dm3z and just returning the Asus. When the Asus came in the mail, I wasn\'t even watching for it like I had been the dm3z. But I did take it upstairs and opened it up. (Unboxing video coming soon...)\n \n \n FIRST IMPRESSIONS\n \n My first impression was astoundingly contradictory to review I had read. I picked it up, squeezed it, pushed on the keyboard, which had minimal flex that wasn\'t noticeable to me when typing. My other first impressions were just how well the trackpad worked. The two finger scroll worked flawlessly (though it isn\'t as smooth of a scroll as Apple\'s, it functions equally responsively and is just as useful). \n \n GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE - Rating 9/10\n \n Over the last view days, I\'ve been taking the UL80VT-A1 out for spin in a series of gaming tests. The first game I tested was the ever popular Counter-Strike: Source. I was astounded by the computer\'s ability to put out 150 FPS in the stress test at native resolution of 1366x768. I had been expecting to get closer to 80-100 FPS. I then tested it with 4x AA on, and it resulted in 99 FPS, which is phenomenal considering that AA usually cripple weaker graphics cards like the Nvidia 210M. \n \n I was eager to test out the UL80VT\'s performance in some of the latest games because of the previous review I had read that had denounced its ability to play modern games. I had recently purchased Batman: Arkham Asylum. I loaded it up with the default settings, which were set on Very High at native 1366x768 resolution. Game play was moderately smooth and playable, but it was also noticably choppy at times with those settings (26 FPS average in the video stress test), so I dropped the settings down to medium. This time the Asus got 40 FPS average in the video stress test, and the game play was perfectly playable and smooth. \n \n I then downloaded Team Fortress 2. It has been known to give ultraportable gaming machines a tough time due to its high shader requirements. When playing, I averaged about 50-60 FPS at native resolution with everything on High with no AA. I noticed drops down to 30 FPS when in heavy action, but it was not too disruptive to game play. I don\'t think it went below 30 FPS during the time I played. \n \n After hearing claims that Asus UL80VT could not run Need For Speed: Shift well. I downloaded the demo to see if these claims were true. Fortunately, they were not. I was able to achieve playable frame rates, though it was a little choopy with the default settings, which had the screen at 1024x768 resolution and everything else up in detail. I tried changing the settings, but after changing the settings to lower the resolution to 800x600, the game repeatedly gave me an error and crashed right as the race was about to start. Unfortunately, I was not able to do a formal test, but it was clear that the game was getting at least 30 FPS at 800x600 resolution with texture settings on High. I would expect the game to be very playable as long as you are content with 800x600 (or maybe slightly better res) and medium settings. \n \n I also managed to squeeze in a little play time in Protoype, another recent game that was released earlier this year. It played very smoothly at the default 1280x720 (which was the max res for some reason) and on the default medium settings. \n \n Another game I was able to try was Call of Duty: World at War, which has identical specs to the latest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. People will be glad to know that I was able to achieve 35-40 FPS constant at native resolution 1366x768 with texture settings on "normal" (except for "shader settings" which I set to "low"). I also turned off all of the extra graphical features, which didn\'t make much of a difference in visuals anyway. \n \n In conclusion regarding the gaming peformance of this ultraportable laptop, it has excellent performance and handles most modern games fluidly at native resolution. \n \n BATTERY LIFE - Rating 10/10\n \n Yesterday, I used the laptop for 3 hours early in the morning with wifi on and brightness up. Later that day, I used it for about 15 minutes running Batman: AA. I then used it about 7 hours more with brightness at about 20% (2.5 hours with wifi on and 4.5 with it off). In total the laptop lasted me 10.25 hours between a mixture of wifi, gaming, and note taking/paper writing. I was extremely happy to get this excellent of performance out of it. This was precisely what I was looking for in terms of battery life.\n \n BUILD QUALITY - Rating 6/10\n \n My initial impression was that the build quality was just average--not great, but nothing bad about it either, but now after having it for a couple days, I now agree with Charles\' review about some of the issues with build quality. Yesterday morning when I was typing, I noticed that when I pressed down on the front edge of the left palm rest it squeaked annoyingly (it hadn\'t pressed down on this part of the laptop when it was on a hard surface yet because it had always been on my laptop up until this point). \n \n I began squeezing the front edge and noticed that top part of the chassis isn\'t cemented to the bottom part of the chassis very well so that when you put pressure on it (such as when you rest your palm on it) it made a noise. I tried placing about an inch long piece of scotch tape across the part that was sqeaking, and the squeaking went away completely. It was disappointing to find this because it was the first issue with the build quality. Also, I now understand what Charles meant when he said that when he pressed in the center of the laptop it causes the bottom of the laptop to touch the surface it is resting on... \n \n It\'s not if you press in the middle of the keyboard like I had thought Charles had said (my bad!!)... it\'s if you press on the trackpad buttons (like Charles had really said), he was right that you can feel the laptop touch the surface it is resting on, but the thing Charles was wrong about is that it isn\'t the bottom of the laptop touching the surface below it... it\'s a little "support peg/foot" that protrudes from the bottom of the laptop about 1/10" of an inch. \n \n The overall chassis does flex a tad, but it is just the peg touching, and the peg is maybe moving 1/16" of an inch tops (probably less). So yes, the chassis does flex just a hair, but not as bad as the review makes it sound (I think the review should be updated with this information personally).\n \n I am thinking about putting a drop of super glue on the edge of the left palm rest to keep it from squeaking. I\'m pretty sure it would work without a hitch unless you put too much glue and then tried to take the casing apart and wasn\'t able to. I figure it wouldn\'t void the 1 year accidental warranty but maybe the 2 year standard warranty if they figured out what I did. I\'m not sure though... I figure you can always "cut through" the glue so that the chassis can be opened if you needed to send it in for repairs.\n \n I also noticed that the entire surface (including the aluminum top) acquires fingerprints. I was disappointed that the aluminum top also was prone to oils from my fingers. \n \n HEAT MANAGEMENT - Rating 10/10\n \n The heat on this bad-boy is hardly noticeable. I think more heat is generated because it is restricting the airflow over your lap more than anything. Whenever my lap started to feel a little warm, I would feel the bottom of the laptop but the bottom of the laptop never got hot. It was always just the fact that my legs weren\'t getting as much air to cool them down. \n \n I was also able to play Batman:AA while on my lap just fine, though it was starting to be mildly uncomfortable by the time 30 mins rolled around. Still, as far as gaming on the lap goes, I think it would be doable, and far more doable than on any other laptop I have ever tried. \n \n This laptop is by far the coolest running laptop I have ever owned (I\'ve owned about 14 different laptops...). For this reason, I give it a 10/10 in heat management. \n \n KEYBOARD - Rating 8/10\n \n Overall, I find the keyboard to be a little above average. I do not like the fact that there are no keys dedicated to playing and pausing music. To access media controls, you must hold the FN button down and tap the arrow keys (down arrow = play/pause). I do not notice any flex when typing. The primary concern that I had was from the squeaky palm rest edge when typing. After I fixed that issue, the keyboard became quite pleasant to use. \n \n TRACK PAD - Rating 9/10\n \n I find the track pad to be the best track pad I have ever used on a PC. It does have a glossy surface, but I did not find that the surface was not nearly as sticky as the surface on many HPs (including the dm3z). I also found the trackpad to be responsive and that the multitouch gestures such as two-finger scrolling to work perfectly nearly every time. \n \n The ELAN touch pad has configurable options to enable you to change the sensitivity of the two-finger scroll as well as enable you to use two and three finger taps to do customizable actions. I have my two-finger tap to do a right click and my three-finger tap to show my desktop. \n \n My only complaint regarding the touch pad is that the uni-button. The uni-button looks like only one button, but has a left side and right side that makes up two buttons. When the uni-button was pressed towards the middle, it was very difficult to click, but if you pressed it near the ends the button became more usable. This was also the case with the Acer Timeline 4810t that I had owned for some time. I have found that the tap to click function is very usable, especially since I can just use two fingers if I need to right click. Therefore, I hardly use the button anymore anyway. My system works just fine. \n \n OVERALL VERDICT - Rating 9/10\n \n Despite its (fixable) flaws in build quality and poor touch pad button (again just use "tap to click" instead), I\'m still impressed with laptop and can definitely recommend it to friends who aren\'t particularly picky about build quality. The UL80VT-A1 will provide the performance most casual gamers want in a portable package that has a very long battery life and is inexpensive compared to similar models. [Oh, wait, scratch that...  There has never been anything like the UL80VT-A1 to ever come out before... except maybe the Acer Timeline 3810TG that had switchable graphics, but that computer was only available in the UK. ]\n \n COMPARED TO THE COMPETITION (DELL STUDIO 14Z and HP DM3Z)\n \n I have now owned a Dell Studio 14z for about two months. I also purchased a HP dm3z, which I had originally planned on writing a review of but I don\'t know if I\'ll find the time. Maybe I\'ll just do a video review... \n \n Anyway, the HP dm3z initially impressed me tremendously with its fantastic metal looks and thin profile. However, two issues became immediately apparent that prevented me from considering the laptop further: the HP dm3z produced a tremendous amount of heat even while just idling (the bottom got roasting hot while playing games... though the palm rests stayed pretty cool) and I quickly became frustrated by track pad lag and malfunctioning two-finger scrolling. The problem with the two finger scroll is due to the fact that it does not always register that you are actually using two fingers, therefore, it thinks you only have one finger down and shoots your mouse all the way across the screen where you didn\'t want it to go. \n \n Beside the two-finger scroll I noticed minimal track pad lag (though there was lag). The track pad was definitely usable and should not prevent someone entirely from purchasing it for that sole reason, but after trying out the UL80VT\'s track pad and comparing the two. It was night and day. The UL80VT\'s was immediately responsive and the two-finger scrolling worked perfectly pretty much all the time. I have sorely missed two-finger scrolling since getting rid of my Macbook Pro a year ago. I am very glad that PCs are starting to make it standard on the majority of notebooks today. Unfortunately, the HP dm3z did not have good enough drivers to make the two-finger scrolling worthwhile. \n \n One thing that I really liked about the dm3z is that it had an excellent keyboard with zero flex and it included media control buttons for the function keys (like Dell Studio 14z). I would definitely recommend the dm3z to people as long as you understand that it is going to produce a lot of heat (especially while watching video/playing games), the track pad is just going to be so-so, and you aren\'t going to achieve the same battery life you would if you went with the UL80VT (unless you went with the intel version with integrated graphics). \n \n I began searching for a new laptop shortly after I found paint chipping on my Dell Studio 14z. It was frustrating since I try to take excellent care of my laptops and chipped paint tends to bring the resale value of laptops down tremendously. All in all, I found my experience with the 14z to be a good one and would recommend the laptop to someone who has a strict budget and can\'t afford a UL80VT. \n \n With the dell, I was typically able to get about 3.5-4.5 hours of battery life (8-cell in windows 7) while surfing the internet-writing documents. The HP dm3z seems to get about 4.5 hrs of web surfing time. The Asus literally doubles the length of my time I am going to be away from the wall (with both the HP and the Dell...). \n \n My primary complaints with the Dell Studio 14z were related to the build quality (paint chipping and noticeable keyboard flex that was causing me discomfort). I loved the back-lit keyboard and will miss that feature on the UL80VT, though I am a touch typist so it will make little difference in terms of actual functionality. \n \n I love the fact that my UL80VT has a DVD-RW because I like to watch DVDs at Starbucks that I rent from Redbox. I couldn\'t do that with the 14z because it lacked an optical drive, but I can do that with the Asus. \n \n It should also be noted that the UL80VT has a better screen than both the Dell and the HP (in my opinion). \n \n IN CONCLUSION\n \n After I discovered the flex, I began contemplating switching over to a Macbook Pro 13". So I went to my local Best Buy to compare sizes, keyboard, touchpad, etc... I got to the store and there was a bestbuy sales guy there that I got to know pretty well when I bought my Dell Studio 14z. I began explaining to him how the 14z hadn\'t met my needs due to a sucky touch pad and paint chipping off for no reason, etc. I pulled my UL80VT out of my bag and explain to him the features of the laptop (i.e. switchable graphics, 10 hour battery life). I loaded up Batman Arkham Asylum and he was amazed that it played smoothly at native resolution. I showed him squeaky palm rest and explained to him I was considering getting a 13" Macbook Pro. He responded pretty quickly that he didn\'t think that apple would have anything that would be an upgrade from this so just recommended that I just stick with the Asus... (lol and he\'s a sales guy that is supposed to sell laptops for best buy, not recommend for me not to buy them... lol)\n \n I agree with the guy at Best Buy. Apple\'s got nothing on the Asus UL80VT... except maybe better build quality, poorer performance, and a $500 dollar increase in price. Hint: get the Asus, unless build quality is of utmost importance to you.\n \n I\'m sorry that this review was so scatter-brained. I like to keep things more organized, but I also just wanted to get this review posted!!\n'

aS"\nVery Nice camera.\n \n Pros:\n \n Controls are intuitive.  \n Battery charge time is minimal.\n Video and sound quality is good.  It's not HD, what do you expect?\n Software works seemlessly with Windows 7.\n Portability. (Fits in your pocket)\n Zoom, focus and adjustments to different lighting conditions are fast.\n \n Cons:\n \n Software could include a couple more options, like alternate soundtrack capability, and the e-mail function is a little vague.\n \n Summation:  Well worth the price.  If you want HD quality, this may not be for you.  If you want ease of operation and portability, look no further.\n"

aS"\nI've been using the TurboScratcher since it came out in the early 80s as a toy and scratching item for my cats.  I have NEVER paid for than about $12-13 for it, and the inserts used to be available from WalMart for 3/$9.  The catnip helps get the attention for the scratching part, and once the see how much fun it is to scratch, they rarely go back to carpet or furniture.  I've had more than one cat that never ONCE went for furniture because I made sure he/she had her own turbo-scratcher from the moment they arrived in my house.  I have one that is a light blue from back in the 80s when everything was light blue and mauve.  If left in the sun a bit too long, they do tend to get a little brittle, but while they feel a little flimsy, they are perfect for the cats.  For those without carpet -- use the rubber shelf or drawer liner cut in a square or circle a couple of inches bigger than the whole toy and it doesn't move at all.  I have never had any problem on any surface until I recently moved into a house with handscraped hardwood floors that are uneven.  This trick worked wonders there and I suspect it would have been more stable on the tile floor in our last house as well, but our cat like to sleep on it in the window in the sun just as much as playing or scratching it.  I recommend one to any cat that I adopt out at rescue, and for my foster babies, I give one to the family that adopts them because that's what I teach them to scratch on and I don't want them developing bad habits of scratching furniture or carpet in their new home -- where they are often trying to cope with the unfamiliar.  I've been told by my adoptive families that this was a really great thing to send esp since it was familiar and they were surprised at how much it was used.  Before replacing the cardboard circle, make sure you turn it over and use both sides!  if they seem a little bored and you are out of catnip, just pic up a little bag of it and it will totally get their attention again.\n"

aS'\nI always thought Hillary would be the first female president. That was until I read this book. Mr. Morris does a great job providing the public with another view of Hillary Clinton that differs from the image she paints of herself in her own book. True...there is always two sides to every story, but at least now we get to see that other side. Morris provides an insight into the former first lady that we haven;t seen before in any other books about her... insight from someone that worked very close to her on a daily basis . This is worth checking out, and as usual... make your own mind up!\n'

aS'\nWhen I first put this album on my wish list, it was something I would have liked to have, but not something that I necessarily needed.  When I first listened to it I said, "Oh this is good." I didnt listen to the whole album at once.  I heard "Undisclosed Desires" and decided I really liked that song, but nothing else really stood out.  Then when I listened further  on in the album, I heard "Exogenesis Part I." I felt like I had been knocked to the floor and my soul had been ripped out; a sign of a really good song for me. I don\'t know how else to describe this piece of music.  It\'s not a song, no not at all, it is a piece of music.  The orchestration and the singing are so hauntingly beautiful and full of emotion I just want to put on headphones, crank up the volume and let the music wash over me, painting pictures in my head.  This is what I like to do when I hear a great piece of music, song or album.\n \n After hearing that piece, I decided to read the lyrics.  When I read the 1984 themed-lyrics and listened to the album once again, I realized that "Resistence" is a Rock Opera.  All of the songs align together in a common Totalitarian-Theme: when he meets the woman he is sneaking around with before the thought police can find them, the Exogenesis Cycle wondering how and when will this world end, "the United States of Euroasia" with its a "Queen-like" anthem in it with a Chopin Nocturne with bombs going off in the background. It is incredible, and even more incredible that Matthew Bellamy is playing the classical piano like a maestro, sticks a Saint Saens excerpt in the middle of "I belong to you", and can sing an impressive Falsetto in "Exogenis Part I."  If you listen to the album as a whole, it will tell you a story, and you realize that you can\'t just listen to one song.\n \n This album is not like any Radiohead that i have ever heard, and in fact that is why I didn\'t like Muse back around 1999-2000 when they were first coming out. I thought that they were trying to mimic Radiohead, and being a Rabbid Radiohead fan that I am, I didn\'t want to buy any of their albums.  That is until I heard the song Supermassive Black Hole.  This album doesn\'t sound like Radiohead, and I think this is Muse\'s new voice in the music world; it shows they are serious musicians and ready to come into their own.  Screw it if it isn\'t radio-friendly.  If that\'s what you care about then don\'t buy this cd because it is not just a Fluff listen while you are doing something else.\n \n Listen to this album and read the lyrics. I love 1984, and this is about the best rendition or homage I have heard or seen.  Crack open a bottle of wine, take out your headphones, light a candle and lay back and enjoy. I haven\'t stopped\n'

aS'\nThere seems to be a lack of reviews online for the new Sony 560 and Panasonic 80 Blu-ray players. So I purchased both of these Blu-ray players from Amazon, mainly becuase I wanted to do a critical, side by side comparison of all features and the audio and video quality. It wasn\'t a professional test-based comparison, just flipping back and forth between these players and my Samsung BD-UP5000 Blu-ray/HD DVD player on my Sony 52" Bravia LCD and studying the image with a critical eye. (I got 3 copies of the Braveheart Blu-ray to do this). Here\'s what I discovered:\n \n Video Quality: Pretty much a dead tie. Both players had rich, dark blacks. Video noise (smoothness) of the pictures was so close that I couldn\'t tell which I was watching most of the time. Sharpness was the same. Both pictures had good "3D pop". I wouldn\'t be surprised if both players used the same chipset. (By the way, the Samsung uses the Reon HQV chip, and while it looked a bit "smoother" by comparison, a tiny bit of the sharpness and detail shown on the Sony and Panasonic was missing on the Samsung. Also the Samsung has a very slight cyan cast to the blacks and the overall picture.)\n \n Audio Quality: I think the Panasonic wins here, but only by a slim margin. Panasonic touts this player as a "high clarity audio" Blu-ray player and it does sound sweet through my Onkyo TS-SR805 receiver, on my Paradigm Monitor 11 speakers. Again, this conclusion is based only on the DolbyHD sountrack on the Braveheart Blu-ray. I\'m going to do more serious listening, but I think the Panasonic will still prove better, audio-wise, with any source material.\n \n Audio Formats: Both of these players will Bitstream or PCM output the new HD audio formats. This means that if your receiver doesn\'t decode them, the player will. Or vice-versa. Some people say pre-amps/receivers do a better job at decoding than BD players do, but I guess that depends on your gear. The Panasonic DMP-BD80 sure sounds good, and I couldn\'t hear a decoding difference between it or my receiver. With the Sony, I think the receiver may have sounded a touch better, but that might have been in my head.\n \n Speed and Handling: No question about it, the Sony beats the Panasonic hands down. This new Panasonic is no faster than last year\'s model it replaced, the 55. Everything about the Panasonic is slow...load times, react times when buttons are pressed, or when skipping chapters. The Sony 560 is about the same as the PS3. Every cloud has a silver lining, and the Panasonic DOES give you time to make a cup of tea while your disc is loading!  Another little thing about the Panasonic that I don\'t like is the size (width) of the disc tray...it\'s the same size or a hair bigger than the disc itself (instead of being smaller like most players) so it\'s very hard to grab the disc. This sounds like a little niggle, but try it and see. It will drive you nuts every time you try to remove a disc...you\'ll end up dropping them back onto the tray if you\'re not extremely careful.\n \n Remote Controls: They\'re about the same...both very flimsy and cheaply made. Put a gun to my head and I\'ll say the Panasonic\'s remote is a little heavier and has larger buttons that are a little better laid out. The Sony 560 is drawing fire for this because it doesn\'t have an eject/drawer open button on the remote. This is a silly complaint...correct me if I\'m wrong, but you almost have to be standing in front of the player to put a disc in or take a disc out anyway, right?!?!?! So what\'s the big deal about having to press the "open" button on the player? Serious remote-picky people have a Harmony remote anyway.\n \n Other Convenience Features: Neither of these players has Netflix built in, I guess that\'s a big deal now. Unless they can steam full-quality 1080P (without pauses, subject to my ISP speed) I could care less about that. The reason I have 3 Blu-ray players is because I care about quality and I\'m not too cheap to buy Blu-ray movies! The Panasonic has the Amazon/VieraCast and YouTube feature though. Again, I have no desire to see a rough, low-quality mpeg video shot by an idiot on a cell phone on my high def TV! Both of these players are BD 2.0 (BD Live) capable, but only the Sony has Wi-Fi built in. That\'s a nice feature because you don\'t have to run a CAT-5 cable from your router to your Blu-ray player. I think the 560 is the first stand alone BD player to have this (the PS3 had it all along). The Panasonic has 7.1 channel analog (RCA) audio outputs, important to people that have older receivers without HDMI. The Sony 560 dropped this feature that used to be on last year\'s 550 model. Most people have newer, HDMI capable receivers, so I see why they did it. (Sony also did it to make their step-up model, the BDPS1000ES seem more attractive. (That player is $699 and is basically a 560 with a handful of extra features added, like a headphone jack). The Panasonic has an SD card slot on the front, good if you want to view your pictures on your TV, and a USB jack. The Sony features two USB jacks, one on the front and one on the back.\n \n Build Quality: About the same, maybe the Sony wins here by a hair. Both are smallish players, not very deep. The Sony is about 8/10\'s of an inch taller.\n \n Conclusion: Overall I like the Sony better. It\'s wireless connectivity is a great feature, and Sony has a great history (with the PS3) of keeping the firmware updated, and this makes it easier. The Panasonic is a nice player, and has slightly better sound, but I\'m sticking with the Sony. Anyone wanna buy a slightly used Panasonic DMP-BD80?\n \n (By the way...I had no audio problems whatsoever with the Sony, like some other reviewers had. The Sony has a lot of audio output settings, and I still think some of them had them set wrong. That, or their other gear couldn\'t handle the output from the 560. I\'m seeing a bunch of posts online recently about different TV\'s and receivers not being compatible or being able to handle certain audio signals, especially bitstream...if your gear doing the decoding doesn\'t have the "oomph" or processing power to decode it, it will choke and puke!)\n'

aS'\nThis movie is so funny - it has situational comedy, parodies, word play, melodrama, etc..  My husband and I laughed out loud for most scenes and smiled through the rest.  The comedic talents of the actors are wonderful - their facial expressions were perfect.  The comedy is witty enough that this movie will hold up to multiple repeat viewings.  I would recommend also seeing the Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood first to appreciate the movie more, but it is not essential - Mel Brooks pokes fun enough at real life incidents.   I do know that some people may find this movie offensive (some friends of ours did).  However, in defense of Mel Brooks, he doesn\'t appear to be advocating any particular lifestyles, just using them as fodder for hopefully the amusement of all.  Parents might want to screen this movie first, as there is a chastity belt, a lustful "cook-witch", and some prisoners give the prison warden the bird.  That said, most of the movie doesn\'t offend (I don\'t want to give away too many jokes, but I do want you to cast your vote for the DVD - there are plenty of jokes like Little John falling into two inch deep water and needing to be rescued).  In these times of uncertainty, we need good belly laughs, and this movie provides that.\n'

aS'\nWhat can one say about a movie based on a computer game. Angelina pulls off the Lara Croft part way better than I thought possible.  I enjoyed her two British sidekicks who unfortunately mostly just stay in Croft Manor. You\'ll recognize Croft\'s butler from the British series \'Red Dwarf.\'  Both he and Bryce do a stand-up job. The sets are all around the world, a bit like a Bond movie, which no doubt increased the production cost. My only complaint is the director or producer (or both) seemed to take the plot way too seriously, they should have had more fun with this. They did on occasion achieve this, such as the scene where Croft asks the Templar #2 guy, "Who sits here? I don\'t think you sit here."  Pretty cheeky, there should have been more humor like this. Not the Roger Moore/James Bond tongue in cheek, but something funny yet ironic.  The DVD version had tons of extra, all of which are watching.  I hv not seen the Blu Ray version but recommend the DVD version. A bit like Bond, but with popcorn plot, not that Bond plots could be taken any more seriously.\n'

aS"\nI first bought these diapers for my daughter when she got her first bad diaper rash at about a month old.  It was one of those rashes that looked as though her skin had been set on fire and nothing seemed to be helping it.

To my amazement, her diaper rash went away within a day and a half of using the diapers and wipes from Seventh Generation.  I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself!

Paris Hilton gives a very unconvincing performance as she tries to do whatever it takes to make her friend a better attractive woman to men. Sadly, for someone who really never learned her lessons and lied about giving back to others on Larry King Live, Paris Hilton showed no effort of changing her ways, and also showed she really doesn't have the drive to act. Not even die hard Paris Hilton fans would even come close to being interested in this movie.\n \n Story: F\n \n Overall: F-\n"

aS'\nWe bought this TV to replace a 27" flat screen (tubed) TV. Easy set-up out of the box, factory settings were just about dead on. We\'re not huge tech heads so it pretty much has everything we were looking for. One thing to note is that if you\'re new to LCD\'s there\'s a little adjustment to be made. The refresh rate on  this is 60hz, the higher end ones are 120hz, I believe plasmas are in the 700hz range. You\'ll notice little things if you\'re up close, like white caps on waves get a little pixelated. Also your old shows like Sienfeld look really lousy up close. After a few months I don\'t notice any of this anymore and we\'re very happy with the TV. We just bought a Sylvania 22" for the bedroom. \n Bottom line, for the average TV viewer, great picture and sound, I wouldn\'t hesitate to buy another one. Also, great customer service when I had trouble hooking my computer up through the HDMI port, changed the PC resolution and all was good.\n'

aS"\nThe instructions with the package are really quite poor. They could do a better job at making sure you go to the video to see a demonstration. Fortunately I read enough reviews to know this ahead of time and installed the protectors without a problem. Didn't really see the point of the side protection pieces. I did put one piece on to protect from the dreaded antenna attenutation problems, but it made the stainless steel look dingy, so I took it off - wasn't having much antenna problem anyway. \n \n The organge peel effect you get with this protector really detracts from the crispness of the iPhone 4 display. And I dislike the tacky feel this protector has - my fingers don't glide, they skid when I'm using the touch screen. I'll be ordering the Powersupport Crystal screen protector when it comes out. Had very good experience with it on my two previous iPhones.

aS"\nWhen I first saw the cover of this paperback in a Georgetown, DC, bookshop a few years ago, I was hesitant to buy it.  Simply put, the cover is goofy, and does not do this masterpiece any justice.  I am so grateful that I  ignored my initial instinct, as I don't remember ever reading a funnier  book in the English language than the late John Kennedy Toole's life  achievement, nor is there a more memorable character in American literature  than I. J. Reilly.  The work deserves a 6 star rating!  &quot;A Confederacy  of Dunces&quot; is more than just incredibly funny, however.  It is  unusually poignant, gut-wrenchingly sad, and an admirable observation piece  on a rather decadent and seemingly lost segment of our society sitting at  the mouth of the Mississippi River.  I have visited New Orleans three times  since 1994 for varied reasons, and the city apparently has not changed in  the least since Mr. Toole's late 1960s rendition.  His characters continue  to stroll and struggle along Bourbon Street and Canal Street, and their  troubled spirits infuse every alley and cave of the French Quarter.  Just  like the district surrounding St. Peter's Square in the city of jazz,  Ignatius J. Reilly is out of step with the rest of America.  In spite of  his repulsive and grossly comical physical presence, he believes in  aesthetics and real meaning, in what he perceives to be the truth.  For  this reason, he is a true literary hero, like Don Quixote, Cyrano de  Bergerac and the Good Soldier Schweik before him.     One final note:  before you buy this book, think about cancelling all your appointments and  engagements for the two or three days that follow.  They, along with eating  and sleeping, undoubtedly will be totally neglected until you finish this  400 page tour de farce.\n"

aS"\nI've tested sound bars from Sony, Yamaha, Philips, Samsung and Polk Audio. Was not able to find the Marantz and Denon models. These products encompass a wide range of price points. The one I bought was the Vizio: great sound and convenience at a price near the bottom of the range.\n \n The wireless subwoofer is an amazing convenience. Its range is at least 20 feet, and it sounds terrific in a variety of placements.\n \n I connected the soundbar to my HDTV console with an optical cable, which works extremely well with one caveat--to activate the audio, the TV must be set on a digital channel. After that, analog audio (including from a DVD player) comes through as normal. If you use the included conventional cable, no issues.\n \n You have limited control options to tailor the sound, but that's to be expected at the price.  Vizio uses SRS Labs' surround virtualization chip and also throws in its volume stabilizer to knock down loud commercial breaks.  This is a cost sacrifice, as the Dolby and DTS HD audio codecs are much more expensive.  No problem; the others sound thin, while the Vizio washes you with clear, powerful sound.\n \n It's not true surround sound, but unlike some rivals, the audio experience isn't overly directional (sounds good throughout the room) and is much better than basic stereo.  If you can't run wire through your walls to deploy full surround, this is a fine compromise.\n"

aS"\nI've loved the trimline phone ever since I got my first phone more than 20 years ago.  Then, the trimline was a real, Bell System, telephone.  Although this phone is clearly not the same as the real Bell trimline phones, it still has the great, comfortable design and the dialpad in the handset, which makes it an excellent choice.  I've compared several other trimline phones and this is the closest phone I could find to the original Bell phones.\n \n Northwestern Bell also makes a trimline phone, but the quality and comfort are nowhere near this AT&T version.\n \n If you read the other reviews, you will see that at least one review (dated November of 2004) says that this phone was discontinued.  Yet, here we are in late November 2004, and its still around.  I'm guessing (could be wrong here) that this phone will be around forever, even though AT&T no longer promotes it on their web-site.\n"

aS"\nFirst off their is no IDE or PS/2 connections so be ready for that.  After I got everything in my computer put together and ready to go I went to plug in my keyboard and it was usb only.  So just find yourself an a adapter or get yourself a new keyboard.  The price of DDR3 is cheap so its not so much a big deal to invest in.  There is one PCI slot and now with the newer BIOS update its SLI compatible which is great since when I read the description it says that its only Crossfire ready.  If you want to go with something beyond two way SLI than you may want to go with the EVGA model which has more DIMM slots as well.  I was going to go with EVGA but my new case would not allow it and I don't have the budget for three cards.  I like the way the board is situated with DIMM slots running vertical and looks like everything is closer to the processor than on other boards I have seen.  I guess when everything is moving at light speed a smallest measurement closer makes a difference on a motherboard.  Install is a cinch just make sure you take your time and don't rush and make a stupid mistake.  I have found that in my experience I mess up on stupid things instead of something big.  Overclocking has been a little more simplified on this board which is what you should probably do if you invest in these boards.  Overall this board has everything that I need with lots of SATA and USB ports and its super fast with my i7 920 along with my 6 Gigs of Corsair Dominator DDR3.  All I can say is I can't wait to get my hands into some overclocking when I get the free time.  Keep in mind only 64 bit Vista will see anything above about 3 and a half gigs so if you don't want 64 than just be ready not to see what you put in.  One minor issue is the setup of the PCI Express slots since I have an 8800 GTS (one of the fatties) and a Creative X-Fi sound card it doesn't leave room for another 8800 GTS without me having to remove my sound card.  Its not that big of an issue though since I plan on getting a smaller newer card anyways.  Though if you have a fat card like me and something in the PCI slot and want to run SLI you might run into trouble so that is worth noting in my mind.  Is this board worth it though I would have to say absolutely yes.\n \n According to Intel sticking in a fourth stick will cause a degrade in performance so since most ram that's DDR3 come in three packs its not so much a big deal.  Also when it first came on and I entered BIOS everything was recognized but I could not get the thing to boot my ROM drive and it would just sit there with a black screen and then it would ask me to select cd drive type 1 or 2.  After about three hours or so it all of a sudden worked after I selected 1 it booted finally and everything was installed (operating system).  The next problem was it would not restart and as soon as my computer would go off and come on again it would be a black screen going nowhere.  Then I remembered update your BIOS dummy and I read all the notes and a lot of issues I had was fixed in the BIOS update including my restart problem.  There was an issue also with my type of ROM drive not booting when put first in priority and that is the issue I had with trying to get it to boot to install my operating system.  Now everything runs perfect and I could not be happier.  The reason I put all this in my review was it did not go as smooth as I thought it would and someone else might have problems.  If you do have issues just drop me a comment and maybe I can help you out just from what I had to do.\n"

aS"\nIn The Bush Tragedy, Jacob Weisberg does what most of President Bush's critics have never tried to do: Take him seriously. In doing so, Jacob paints a devastating portrait of a man haunted by his father, crippled by a fatal lack of curiosity, and driven by ego to pursue aggressive and ill-considered policies. His Bush is not the cartoon of ignorant evil imagined by many of the president's critics, but a deeply complex man whose intellectual and emotional shortcomings have made him a disastrous president. Jacob, who (full disclosure) is a colleague and friend, has unearthed extraordinary new details about Bush's religious conversion, ancestral history, and family dynamics. My favorite bit--check it out on page 90--is an anecdote about how the president, always willing to make his own reality, decided that a painting of a horse thief was actually a portrait of a brave evangelist minister.\n"

aS'\nThis 70 pg. book was originally published in 1956 in the journal Psychoanalysis as "Psychoanalytic Observations on Chess and Chess Masters".  As one can derive from this title, the author has attempted to present us with a deeper understanding of certain chess masters using psychoanalysis, and in the process comes up with some interesting but also peculiar (in my opinion, at least) insights. In particular, Fine discusses the following players: Staunton, Anderssen, Morphy, Steinetz, Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Euwe, and Botvinnik.  For someone not familiar with the personalities of these exceptional players, Fine\'s anecdotal accounts of their personalities and eccentricities is quite facinating.  What kind of made me leary was the general remarks that the author makes in regards to chess and chess players, and how in particular he seems to sexualize the purpose of chess.   For instance, on page 22 he states: "The profuse phallic symbolism of chess provides some fantasy gratification of the homosexual wish, particularly the desire for mutual masterbation.  This is, of course, completely repressed.  Checkmate may be seen as rendering the father impotent, again part of the homosexual complex."  Oh, really?  And here I thoight that chess was a game, to be played for fun and enjoyment, or in some cases competatively.  I can\'t quite remember ever feeling that it was the expression of a "desire for mutual masterbation"--well, how could I, because I can\'t, since I\'m repressing it.  Well, that\'s just pure bunk, in my opinion.  Fortunately, this book isn\'t entirely like this, so it does have its merits, but it clearly isn\'t must-read chess literature.\n'

aS"\nMy boyfriend thought it would be funny, so he picked one up at Walgreens and gave it to me. \n \n It started out as a joke, but guess what? I actually ended up liking this thing - a lot! I've had it for almost a year and I use it all the time (when the weather is chilly). The material is thin, and it looks cheap. I was not impressed with it when I first saw it, but after using it I discovered that even though it is thin, it's still really warm. I have washed it many times and it is still in great condition. It's soft and my dog really likes snuggling with me when I use it. \n \n The other day we went to Petsmart and discovered the dog Snuggie. Of course my boyfriend had to get it. It was supposed to be another joke. Me and my dog with matching Snuggies! I honestly did not expect my dog to wear it, but he really loves it too. He won't let me take it off. The box is really funny. There is a picture of a dog relaxing on the couch with his remote control and another picture of a couple of dogs playing backgammon. (I'm easily ammused, I suppose)\n \n In summary, it started out as a joke. The Snuggie has provided me with lots of laughs. But more importantly, I love my Snuggie because it does what it says it will do - it keeps me warm and comfortable, and yet, my hands are free! \n \n \n"

aS'\nI don\'t know anyone who loves Dick Morris.  Some people hate him and cannot hear anything he says.  Just bringing up his name upsets them to the point of unreason.  Yet, if one can simply consider what he has to say it is usually interesting and often worthwhile even if you strongly disagree with what he has to say.  This is because he really does understand how our political emotions work and the kinds of issues that provoke the electorate to action.  Whether or not he actually believes what he is saying on behalf of a politician or about an issue is not all that relevant.  Personal convictions often wither under the hot sun of political campaigns.  Even so, this book seems to be more about the frustrations Morris and McGann share with us about how both the Democrats and the Republicans are failing us in Congress.\n \n His take on the immigration problem is actually quite fresh.  Rather than focusing only on the border with Mexico, he points out that at least half the problem, and the more serious failure in preventing another 9/11, is the millions who overstay their visas.  They come in legally, but fail to leave as required.  Since we do not track who leaves the country it is all but impossible to find out who is here in violation of their visas!  Morris says that we not only need to begin tracking those who leave so we can get some idea who remains, but we also need to bar all immigration from those countries that are designated as sponsors and supporters of terror.\n \n The United Nations and its many failures and scandals are examined next.  Morris and McGann show us why there is absolutely no motivation within the United Nations to behave well and how the organization\'s structure actually promotes human rights failures by putting the worst violators on the committees that are supposed to monitor and take action against situations such as Rwanda and Darfur.  The authors also show us how Oil For Food was used by Saddam to not only line his own pockets at the expense of his people, but corrupted the political choices many of those nations who made our work in Iraq more difficult before the war, leading up to the war, during the war, and in helping Iraq build its own government.\n \n The efforts within the ACLU to suppress public criticism by its leaders of its leadership and policies are actually quite humorous and sad.  It is hypocrisy of the first order and something more people need to be aware of when dealing with this organization that views itself as the final arbiter of our rights and social order.  They need to be exposed more fully and we need organizations to resist and balance them more than we have now.\n \n Chapter four is the big biggest because it is where the authors expose the problems in Congress with travel, using family members to convert campaign contributions to cash, using family as lobbyists, and how little time they put in working on the people\'s business.  Morris and McGann pull no punches and name names from both parties.  This chapter alone makes reading this book worthwhile.  However upset with Congress you are now, you will be more angry after reading and thinking about the facts presented here.\n \n We also get chapters on how the Patriot Act and the NSA "wiretapping" (actually data mining) have helped in the War on Terror, how the teacher unions are actually hurting our efforts to educate our children (not the teachers - the UNIONS), how big pharma is spending huge money on Congress to keep their billions in profits flowing in, and how Fannie Mae is misusing its mandate and money to support many Democrat causes.\n \n Morris and McGann then do an excellent job in going after the Republicans for the bankruptcy bill that prevents people such as those suffering from cancer and oceans of medical bills from getting a fresh start.  The credit companies also basically shove credit on people they know shouldn\'t have it and then want to avoid the risks of these bad business practices and keep these folks more or less permanently enslaved to them.  The authors also go after the terrible changes Congress made to the student loan programs.\n \n We also get information about how insurance companies are trying to get out of the hurricane Katrina claims by saying they would pay for wind damage, but not water damage.  Right.  How do you get a hurricane without water damage?  I have been in a hurricane.  The water is a fundamental part of the storm.  Why should we allow them to get away with this?\n \n We also get a chapter on how some tobacco companies, even after all the bad exposure and supposed settlements and public humiliation are STILL raising the nicotine levels in their cigarettes.  There is also a chapter on how Gerhard Schroeder and Jacques Chirac have acted in quite corrupt ways.  The final chapter is how Congress yields to special interests and trade protections in the name of saving jobs.  These saved jobs cost us many hundreds of thousands of dollars each.  And they also drive industries out of the country.  For example, any number of candy companies have moved production to Canada and elsewhere so they can buy sugar at the world price and remain competitive rather than keeping the plants and jobs in the U.S. and paying more than twice the world price for sugar.\n \n This book should tap into the current disgust the majority of Americans rightly feel for Congress.  We should be rotating even more of them out in 2008 and hope the material here gets people motivated to do just that.\n'

aS"\nI had imported Demon's Souls in April, and finished it 3 times since then. I have a long review below but if you want a few sentences here it is: \n \n The game has an excellent atmosphere, great character customization, enjoyable combat, some unique online elements, but very little story and minimal npc interaction. It is also very unforgiving, but it is strangely addictive if you don't get frustrated easily. It takes about 40 hours in your first play through. It's not because the game is huge... It's because you'll die a lot and repeat a lot, which results in playing very cautiously (which also adds to the atmosphere). \n \n ***Review***\n \n Demon's Souls is an action RPG game with some unique online elements. I loved the game but I can also see why some people (even RPG lovers) might hate it. Although I gave it 5 stars, I cannot say the game is for everyone. Just read the paragraph at the end where I explain some game mechanics, and if it sounds frustrating to you then might want to try the game first before buying.\n For me 3 things are very important for an RPG. A good story and well-developed characters, deep character customization, tactical and fun combat.\n \n Story\n \n In DS, the people in different realms/worlds are possessed by demonic souls and you are to get rid of them. When you kill them you collect their souls and get more powerful and eventually fight against the final demon. That's basically it. The game has very little story and minimal amount of non player characters (NPCs). There are about 15-20 NPCs in total (including the merchants and blacksmiths), and most of them are located in a hub called Nexus. Furthermore, you can talk to them but there are no dialogue trees. They'll say 2-3 new sentences after each time you kill a demon boss, giving you some background about the setting. Sometimes they'll initiate a sidequest, by asking you to find/do something. That's all. \n \n If you are expecting something like Mass Effect or JRPGs in terms of story or dialogue this is not it. However, the game has a very dark and immersive atmosphere. It just sucks you in and makes up for its lack of story. Also, sometimes new characters/enemies appear depending on World Tendency (world tendency is something like an alignment that can change toward black or white), which provides replay value. \n \n In sum, unlike most other RPGs, this is not a game that you play for the story. There is minimal story and dialogue, but the game has an excellent atmosphere which gives you the feeling of being alone and overwhelmed.\n \n Character Customization\n \n Character customization is probably the most important aspect of an RPG and this is where the game shines. You start the game with a certain class you picked, but it doesn't restrict you. You can develop your stats in anyway you like and completely turn it into something else (kind of like Oblivion). For example, weapons/armors have different stats requirements, but they are not restricted to classes. As long as your character meets the stats requirement you can use it. So you can mix and mash classes anyway you like. There are 8 different attributes, and when you level up you can raise one of those attributes by one point (there is room for up to 99 for each attribute). \n \n Weapon upgrades are done by using the ores you find. You can do regular upgrades (e.g. long sword +2) or you can change it into a different weapon (e.g. dragon long sword) depending on the ores you found. There are several different types of ores that opens a different upgrade branch. There are also some special upgrades, if you choose to use a demon's soul that you obtained from a boss, which will give you a unique weapon. \n \n Combat\n \n The customization also affects your gameplay. For instance, you can wield double swords, sword and shield, sword and crossbow, sword and a wand, two shields (if you want to be fancy) etc. Moreover, any sword can be wielded two handed or one handed. Of course, if you choose to wield a two handed sword with one hand, you character becomes clumsy. If you choose to wield a one handed sword with two hands, then you make stronger attacks with different animations. \n \n The combat is in real time and it is like an action game. In the controller, L1-L2 is assigned to the left hand, and R1-R2 is assigned to the right hand. L1 is used for guarding, L2 is either for parry (when wielding a shield) or attacking (weapon on left hand)). On the other hand, R1 is regular attack, and R2 is strong attack. You can also roll, run, but you cannot jump. So you end up having different combat gameplay and tactics depending on what you choose to equip. \n \n Online Gameplay\n \n If your PS3 is connected to the internet, you'll automatically play the game online. That lets you do different things. First, you'll see some messages left by other players. They can provide some clues, warnings etc. You can also leave messages but you can only create them by combining preset words and phrases. You cannot type whatever you want. And if someone finds your message helpful and rates it, then your health replenishes. Second, you'll see pools of blood and if you touch them it will show you a ghost of some other player and how he/she died. It's just another clue to help you in the game. \n \n Third, and the most important one, is playing with/against others. If you are in body form, you'll see blue signs on the ground left by other players. By touching those signs you can summon up to two more people to your game and they'll fight along with you in your game helping you out. On the other hand, when you are in body form some other player can invade your game and try to kill you. If you are in soul form, then you can put a blue sign on the ground in order to be summoned by others or you can use an item to invade another player's game.  However, you cannot just invite your friends to your game. If you and your friends are on different servers (which you have no control over) you won't see the signs they left and will not be able to summon them. If you happen to be on the same server, you can arrange a location in the game to put the sign (via XMB message) and then summon the other person.\n \n Conclusion\n \n In sum, Demon's Souls is one of the best games on PS3. It has a great atmosphere and addictive gameplay that makes you come back, even after you died for the tenth time in the same boss battle. Unfortunately it is not a game for the impatient. Just take a look at the cover art (the regular cover art which happens to be the Deluxe Edition cover in US release) of the game. You see a lone, battered knight, who is about to give up. That's Demon's Souls for you. If you are willing to take the challenge, victory will be very satisfying.\n \n ***About the difficulty and potential frustration***\n \n First of all, the game is very unforgiving. Even regular enemies can kill you with 1-2 blows, and they will kill you many times. However that's not the main issue. The real difficulty comes from not being able to save in the middle of a stage/map. The stages don't have checkpoints either. Also dying is very costly. When you die, first you will drop your souls at the location you died (You gain souls by killing enemies, and souls are used as both experience points to improve your stats and also as money). Then you will lose your body (which means losing half of your life bar, making the game even harder) and you will respawn in soul form at the start of the stage. However all the enemies will also respawn. Furthermore, if you die again before reaching the location you died, you will lose all the souls you have dropped previously for good. That means no experience/no money from all that playing. Also reaching your corpse does not give your body back, it only gives back your collected souls. You can gain your body (half of your life bar) if you beat a boss, or invade another player's game and kill him/her, or use a special item. \n \n In brief, you will be playing the same stage from the beginning over and over again, until you beat the boss at the end of the stage. In a lot of cases, you will not gain any experience/level during this process, because you'll die a second time before reaching your corpse. However, the stages are not very big. It generally takes about 5 to 10 minutes to get to the boss if you know the way and IF you don't die. A new respawn point appears at the end of the stage, after a boss is defeated. (The game has 5 worlds and each world has 4 stages/bosses). So, after you beat a boss you can spawn from that location if you want. \n \n Still, a lot of people would probably hate this no save/checkpoint mechanic combined with the games unforgiving difficulty. It's like 80s arcade games which takes you back to the beginning of the stage when you die.\n \n"

aS"\nI ordered this product after watching the infomercial late one night. (Insomnia sometimes has it's benefits) As someone who used to do hair for a living, I have tried nearly everything on the market. My shower rack was always overflowing with numerous shampoos and conditioners, but no more. This delicious smelling, one-step cleanser/conditioner is the only product I use now. I have somewhat fine hair that's a bit dry from color treatments and I needed a product that would restore a healthy shine and manageability without over-conditioning. WEN cleansing conditioner does the job all in one step. I apply about two to three pumps to wet hair when I first get in the shower then rinse out as the last thing. You can add a tiny drop after as a leave-in conditioner. You'll be amazed at the results regardless of your hair type. One last tip, unless you have extremely thick long hair that's as dry as the Sahara desert, you do not need to use the recommended amount of 16-24 pumps. You'll figure out  the right amount for your hair. Also, buy it here on Amazon and don't get caught up in the auto shipments required on the infomercial. Happy conditioning!\n"

aS"\nI loved this book--I don't know when I've laughed so hard.  Maybe it helps that I'm a &quot;liberal&quot;--but what makes this a good book rather than just a book that says things I happen to agree with is that it's clever and well-executed.  The humor runs from silly to witty, but it's pretty consistently funny.   It's too bad the satire seems to be lost on some people.  The point of the book is that Franken is using the same methods that Rush Limbaugh &amp; co. use in a _satirical_ fashion in order to expose these methods as ridiculous.  Take his &quot;interview&quot; with Rush Limbaugh, modeled after the latter's &quot;interview&quot; with Hillary Clinton.  Yes, obviously it's quite easy to come up with the same sort of &quot;interview&quot; with Al Franken, but that doesn't do much to hurt his case.  The point of the Rush Limbaugh interview isn't so much to make Rush admit that he is indeed a big fat idiot by taking his words out of context as to make fun of the idea of such an interview as a cheap shot with which you can make anyone say anything.  So you can't really use Franken's methods against him to make him out to be a hypocrite, because the basis of the book is a humorous refutation of those very methods.  That's why it's funny.\n"

aS"\nI bought this hard disk primarily for use with Apple Time Machine from two Mac laptops - a Macbook and a Macbook Pro. The drive comes formatted for Windows but a reformat only took a few seconds. Usable space on the drive is 931.5GB -  I have the drive partitioned, 600GB for Time Machine and 330GB for general usage.\n \n The drive is very smart, with a textured top and glossy sides and has rubber feet. Both connectors (power and usb) are at the back, next to a white activity light, so there's nothing flashing at the front. The power lead is fairly compact (compared to my Lacie FA Porsche drive), with the transformer built in to the plug rather than halfway along the lead. Even the USB cable is well designed, with moulded easy-grip ends.\n \n The drive is almost completely silent and runs very cool despite having no fan. I've probably moved about 1TB on and off it over the last 24 hours and it's never even been warm. Transfer speeds seem to be around 1GB/minute for both large files (a 200GB SuperDuper sparseimage) and many small files (my 50GB iTunes library), which is about standard for a USB hard disk as far as other reviews say. This equates to about 130Mb/s - USB is apparently capable of 480Mb/s, but I've never seen those speeds.\n \n The drive has a two year warranty in the UK/Europe, which I think is the same as other drives in the WD range (although the My Book Elite has 3 years).\n \n All in, for a budget external drive this is a great buy with solid build and performance to match any decent USB drive.\n"

aS'\nSpent a weekend reviewing various GPS devices to replace my less than 1 year old Mio C320 (avoid these like the plague) that had its battery die about 4 months after purchase.  Went back and forth along the entire line of Garmin devices, and finally settled on this one for the blue tooth and traffic, neither of which I\'ll probably hardly ever use, but nice to have when I want them.  \n \n I was disappointed with the map, the "new" 2009 one, because I have some streets in my neighborhood that have been around for over four years and they\'re not to be found on this unit.  Even the piece of junk cheap Mio had these streets. \n \n But that\'s about the only downside there is to it, the only reason I haven\'t given it 5 stars.\n \n Having been used to the MIO, and the horrible refresh rate, it is a pleasant change to see smooth scrolling as my vehicle moves.  The ability to change the car icon is nice, especially with the plethora of icons available on the garmin website.\n \n Accuracy is very good as well, and even in turns the unit isn\'t so laggy that it becomes annoying.  And also unlike what I was used to with the MIO, when I come to a stop at the intersection, the map doesn\'t start rotating randomly on me.\n \n Speaker is about as I expected, won\'t hear much over a loud stereo but crank it up enough you can at least hear it if you keep the music down a bit.\n \n The option to easily download voices is also appreciated.\n \n It did well with my testing of going point to point, following the instructions, and for the most part you\'re given the instructions in plenty of time.  only once or twice did it not tell me "turn right on such and such" until I was about 20 feet from the street, but that was when I was coming up on stop signs and had slowed down, so it may be compensating for the speed factor.\n \n Recalculation notice is a bit annoying, my MIO would say it once, sometimes this says it three times before it starts to display the alternate route.\n \n Still has about 900MB free on the internal memory for additional voices, icons, maps, and such, and with the SD slot there\'s plenty of room to grow.\n \n I have a Verizon XV6900 phone with Windows Mobile 6.1, and while the bluetooth paired well and it can see the phone status, battery power, signal, even dialed and missed call lists, it never does get the phonebook.  it gets a random entry and that\'s it - so whenever I turn it on, I have just one user to select from, and it\'s different each time.  Still haven\'t tracked that one down yet.  But every other bluetooth option worked just fine.\n \n I\'m not a fan of the very thick double power cable for it though, and it would be doubly annoying (no pun intended) if I were mounting this somewhere higher up on the window to have that double cable dangling down.\n \n I can see how the ads would get annoying sometimes (the free traffic is because it is advertising driven) but you don\'t get them at all if you turn off the traffic feature, and since most of my driving isn\'t around times that traffic is a concern, i can just leave it for when I really have a use for it.\n \n Good response to finger input, and while the unit is overall much better quality than the MIO, I really do miss the MIO\'s ability to have an info pane down the last third of the screen and the map on the first two thirds of it when desired.  But there\'s some of that info available in the data bubbles on the bottom and top so I\'ll survive.\n \n Overall happy with the unit, it works well and was worth the cost.\n'

aS'\nSo far this is pretty boring. Written from the mother\'s point of view and the daughter\'s point of view, alternating between the two. No depth to characters. No real insight. Much about the possible negative aspects of the mother daughter relationship. It has these annoying "excerpts" from an advice column(?), or books regarding mothers & daughters, which is annoying. I am half way through the novel and I am wondering- "what is the point?"  I probably won\'t continue to read it-will skip to the end.\n'

aS'\nThe best review from a former iPhone and Blackberry user.\n \n I have been in love with the G1 since it came out a year ago, but I couldn\'t get over that ugly chin sticking out! I was beyond ecstatic when the MyTouch 3G was released, but after playing with the device for 3 hours I realized what a piece of crap it was and returned it. The screen wasn\'t that big and it made texting and instant messaging a living nightmare. In addition to that, the phone was not multi-touch capable, so if you\'re a fast texter and really quick with the emails then the MyTouch 3G is not for you. The virtual keyboard could only handle one letter at a time and I found myself hitting the wrong letters on so many occasions. I would hit a letter and the phone would pick up the surroundings letter. This really is ashame because the thirty-five dollar data plan is mandatory and its travesty that one can\'t even use it to the best of their ability. The lack of a keyboard also made the MyTouch 3G a big downer. Anyway, I digress. \n \n Now, let\'s get to the Motorola Cliq. This phone is everything that the G1 and MyTouch 3G should have been, but better. This device doesn\'t come with Eclair (Android OS 2.0), but it functions just fine. Hopefully a mandatory upgrade will be made available to all Android users soon. This is a great PDA smart phone for anyone who is heavy into texting, emailing, and surfing the web. It\'s a full featured phone, but at the same time it\'s nothing groundbreaking. There is definitely some acclimation when it comes to the Cliq because I am so use to my Blackberry 8900 and I think its one of the best built devices with a very responsive well built OS. \n \n If you\'re looking for a device that is very similar to the iPhone on the T-Mobile network then this is probably the closest that you will ever get. My initial impression of the phone was not a good one because it kept asking me to create a user name and password. I thought it was asking for an email address (Yahoo, AOL, Gmail), but it wasn\'t. It was asking you to create a MotoBlur account. I did, but kept getting an error message. T-Mobile customer service didn\'t know what to do and [...] has an area to sign into MotoBlur & an option to create a motoblur account, but when you click it there\'s nothing on screen that lets you create a name/password. \n \n Android OS - Many people have said that the Android OS is a game changer since its release back in the fall of 2008. It seemed like the only thing at the time to combat with the forces of the iPhone. To some extent it is and to some extent it\'s just not quite there yet. To be honest it\'s a bit on the clunky side. It does take a few seconds to exit out of certain applications, or to even get to the main home screen menu when exiting out of email and texting. When you become so use to using your cell phone for just about everything - speed is everything. That also includes how responsive and quick your phones OS is. My only gripe is that I wish there wasn\'t that few second lag in-between operations.\n \n Motoblur - The Cliq includes MotoBlur which lets you connect your Facebook, MySpace, and twitter accounts directly to the advice, so whenever your friend writes a new comment it immediately goes to the homepage of the phone. This is a great idea and saves you time from going into the web browser and having to log in each account in order to check for updates. However, this feature is a battery killer. I have mine turns off, besides if you lend your phone to someone else to use (To make a call or use web browser) they will all be up in your business. I could careless about this feature. \n \n \n Email - This is also not an Android device that has Google branding with it. It\'s just a Motorola phone using the Android OS. There is NO G1 branding logo anywhere. However, you can still sync up your Google email address, but the Gmail feature is such a disappointment. Synchronization has to be turned on for the Gmail to function to the best of its ability & that\'s a BIG battery draining feature. You can also sync your Yahoo & AOL email addresses. The AOL and Yahoo email feature is way better then Gmail and doesn\'t require synchronization to be turned on. This helps save tremendous battery power. When you send an email from your desktop it doesn\'t come to the phone right away, but you can set the phone to check for new emails every 15 mins, 30 mins, or manually, etc. It doesn\'t work the same with Gmail which is a big let down. I am a big fan of the Blackberry and it\'s the only device on the market that gets an email within 2 seconds of sending it. The same can\'t be said for the Android OS. Much work needs to be done. \n \n Web Browser - One of the best features on any android device including the Cliq is the web browser. Surprisingly, it doesn\'t launch [...] as the main homepae when you click browser. The Android Browser is probably one of the best browsers on the market right now and is up there with the Safari Browser and the Palm Pre\'s browser. You cant pinch and zoom to enlarge the way you can on the iPhone, but there are zoom in controls which are easy to use. You also get a dedicated YouTube app that lets you watch Youtube videos. Though the video clips aren\'t as sharp as the iPhone - There is a setting and option when you are watching the YouTube clip where you can see the videos in "Higher Quality" so its crystal sharp and less blurry. \n There is a big difference that one will notice when switching from standard to HIGHER QUALITY.\n \n 3G - TMobile recently launched their 3G network about a little over a year ago, so they are still building from the ground up while the other networks are already moving into 4G. It\'s great that the CLIQ has 3G, but it does get spotty and unresponsive sometimes. There were many times that the 3G would switch between 3G and EDGE. I didn\'t have that big of a problem with it, but I am sure over time it will get better. Wi-Fi is also included, so this is a great alternative for someone who might be at home and only has EDGE access.\n \n Instant Messaging - The CLIQ comes with Yahoo Messenger, Google Talk, and AIM pre-installed. My Blackberry 8900 came with all 3 and included ICQ & Windows Live. Another thing about the IM that was such a disappointment is that synchronization had to be activated in order for you to sign into the messaging client, which in turn drains the battery power like crazy. This was such a disappointment. My BB never had this issue. You sign in and start chatting. There was no extra setting that had to be activated in order to chat, but on the CLIQ it\'s a requirement. The extra requirement only means that you have to charge you phone twice in one day because of heavy unnecessary usage.\n \n Motorola really could have done a better job with the CLIQ, especially for the price. But I think most of the minor flaws have to do with the Android OS. I was originally an iPhone user that became a Blackberry user and I have to hand it to the Blackberry because it\'s quick, responsive, and built in such a way that its function is superb. Everything from Email to text to instant messaging is just so quick. There is hardly any lag and it\'s easy to learn how to use. The Blackberry so far is the best PDA I have ever used, but its web browser needs work. Pick up the CLIQ phone because it\'s a winner. There are some minor flaws, but the pros outweigh the negative. \n \n Pros: \n Android OS (Can be a pro & a con)\n Full HTML Web Browser \n Threaded Text message \n Email sync \n Android Marketplace \n Full qwerty keyboard \n YouTube Application\n 5.0 camera/camcorder \n Big vibrant screen \n 3.5 MM headjack \n Decent call quality (No issues yet) \n Mini SD up to 32GB \n Use your songs as ringers \n Wi-Fi \n Personal Email (Up to 10 accounts can be added) \n IM\n My Favs \n Excellent Multimedia Player \n Includes 2 chargers (Wall Charger & USB charger) \n T-Mobile offers the best minute and data plans on this planet \n \n Cons: \n Poor Battery Life (Lower light setting and turn off Motoblur to save power) \n Gmail is a disaster (Not push capable) \n Needs better notification options when next text/emails come through \n No PUSH email capability \n Trackball (I miss you) \n Occasional lag time when entering/exiting a screen/app\n Micro USB (No more Mini USB) \n No ear phone or free carry case\n'

aS'\nI, like many, was very interested in this woman\'s journey. I kept reading hoping that there would be a moment when the author would reveal some revelation or personal growth out of her horrible circumstances. However, the book was unorganized and pointless. I found the author to be a typical academic stuck in a library and unaware of how to relate to the real world. Her condescension towards her heritage and anyone that isn\'t "brilliant" is ironic since she has made some really pathetic personal decisions in her life. I also was offended by what seemed to be her disdain for Christianity, which showed her true lack of understanding of it. I do not recommend this book, and I would be, quite frankly, embarrassed to pass it along. I found her comments about her own people disrespectful. And finally, as others have mentioned, if you are going to read it, have a dictionary standing by.\n'

aS"\nI've listened to lots of music, and &quot;Superunknown&quot; doubtlessly stands as arguably the best album I have ever heard.  Visionary, perfectly executed and technically impeccable, Soundgarden set the standard for dark hard rock with this one.  I can't really think of a place to start in praising this album, but Chris Cornell's vocals are as good a place as any.  From the hushed tones of &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot; to the cathartic wailing of tunes like &quot;My Wave&quot; and the propulsive singing of &quot;Fourth of July,&quot; Cornell can simply do it all.  His dark, churning, guitar riffs, aided by Kim Thayil's soaring, distorted solos, complete the powerful atmosphere of these songs.  Add in Matt Cameron's nimble and inventive drumwork and the result is a musical masterpiece.  The variety of this album is also noteworthy, as it mixes hard rockers like the opening double shot of &quot;Let Me Drown&quot; and &quot;My Wave&quot; with slower, more melodic numbers like the hits &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot; and &quot;The Day I Tried To Live.&quot;  The megahit &quot;Black Hole Sun,&quot; while a strong song, is easily the worst track on the album, with the exception of the filler track &quot;Half.&quot;  &quot;Superunknown&quot; boasts all that serious music fans could possibly want, from creativity to technical precision to complex arrangements to a truly masterful and powerful overall vocal performance from Chris Cornell.  A masterpiece in every sense of the word.\n"

aS'\nBic makes terrific blue ink pens; I remember writing many a paper for college using pens like these before computers came along. Bic calls these pens "medium point" but the ink is quite clear on the page. The blue ink lasts for months--unless you write a lot with these every day in which case they will last a shorter amount of time. \n \n The pens are compact and easy to carry with you; this makes them easy to carry because they are so lightweight. The pens are made of plastic with a see through ink tube inside them. The advantage of the see through ink tube is that you can tell when the pen is running low on ink--a great feature! \n \n As nerdy as it sounds, gentlemen can easily carry one or two in their shirt pockets. I would keep the cap on, of course. \n \n Actually, I would keep the cap on at all times when not using this pen. The ink still inside the pen can dry out rather quickly without the cap being on them. Moreover, you don\'t want ink to leak out of the pen and make nasty ink stains. \n \n Overall, if you want an inexpensive pen that still gives you high quality writing ink, you can\'t go wrong with these pens by Bic. I have used them for decades with great satisfaction. \n \n I highly recommend these pens for anyone wanting an inexpensive but good quality blue ink pen.\n \n'

aS'\nFirstly I\'d like to say I\'m a 43 year old mom. I got into gaming several years ago and my kids and I have a lot of fun with the Nintendo DS. We have had the original DS, DS Lites, DSi\'s, and now the DSi XL. I got an XL for myself. My son has many GBA games so he doesn\'t want one (because the DSi XL cannot play any GBA - Gameboy Advance- games) and my daughter thought it was too big to be portable. She likes something that fits easily into a backpack or jacket pocket. Although I think the XL could I\'d probably agree if you are going for portability then the regular DSi should do you just fine. The reason I chose the XL is because I play primarily at home and I play a lot of puzzle games. Someimes these types of games are hard to see, especially the seek and find. I\'m hoping this larger sized one helps that. \n \n Even though I knew it was larger it is LARGER than I thought. That\'s a good thing because it is almost more like a PDA or something as far as size. Nice and substantial. It is also heavier than I anticipated. This is the only thing I\'m a little concerned with as I like to play laying in bed at night and sometimes I\'ll play for a couple of hours. I would not want my hand getting extra tired holding the unit up. Additionally it is not as easy to hold this one handed and put the stylus in the other. It might be a fine line but it doesn\'t quite feel as comfortable as the DSi in that regard. It feels similar to how the PSP would feel if you held it one handed. Slightly off balance. Edited to Add: Played for 2 hours last night. Although it took a while I did find a comfortable position to hold the XL. It is not as comfortable for extended periods as the regular DSi but it did not get too heavy and my arms did not get sore. I\'m quite relieved!\n \n The top part actually has an audible click when you open up the unit. The DSi did not have this click although one of our DS Lite units did. The regular DSi opened smoothly without any catches--this one does not. There is definitely a click. The hinge looks strong enough. We lost one DS Lite to the hinge crack issue so I\'m glad to see these hinges look sturdy. The other thing regarding the hinges is that the top piece moves a little when you move the unit. It is not super floppy but it does move when the unit does. I tested it against the DSi and the DS Lite and it took more effort to make those cover or top pieces move. It may be the weight itself which causes this. I will be keeping an eye on my hinges though just to be sure. \n \n It connected right up to my internet with no problems. I went into the DSi shop and I didn\'t notice any difference between the XL and my regular DSi. Flawless. I must say, though, that I HATE that I could not take my DSi games with me to this upgrade (Nintendo is so far behind the ball on this and it is one of few complaints I have of Nintendo). Lame Nintendo. Seriously lame!\n \n I got the bronze. It has a nearly black top and the inside is black. The bronze is only on the bottom and sides and it is definitely bronze. From the pictures online it looks more chocolate brown but it is not. I wavered back and forth with this and burgundy. I have not seen the burgundy out of the box but suspect it looks gorgeous. The glossy top looks like an overcoat similar to what is put on cars and trucks. Not like how the DS Lite covers were (although in two tone color this one is nearly exactly the same as the DS Lite Crimson or Blue with the colors in the same places and black in the same places except for the top because this one has the bronze color around the edges and the DS Lite\'s had the crimson or blue).\n \n It does not feel "matte" on the bottom.It has a slightly grainy feel--not sure how to describe it. Kind of like how the non shiny cover of my printer feels. I remember when I got the DSi it almost seemed grainy and powdery. Not so with the XL.  \n \n Overall I\'m very happy with the color-its classy!\n \n Screen: This was my big worry. So far those worries are fairly groundless. I\'ve tested out several types of games and in most apsects it is absolutely as good as the regular DSi. For the most part I get no pixelation or stretching and I definitely haven\'t noticed any ghosting or lines. While I was playing Bejeweled Twist I did notice that the gems were not as crisp as they are on the regular DSi. For me it was noticable but not bothersome. They were not blurry just a little more fuzzy than normal.  \n \n Edited to Add: I\'ve tried several additional games and haven\'t noticed any issues except on games like Lunar Knights which already had a more pixelated look even on my DS Lite and regular DSi. Just slightly more noticable here but again not enough to impact. If I wasn\'t such a video game addict I likely wouldn\'t notice but I play every day. \n \n My original DSi had several problems (Nintendo sent me a replacement)-this one has none of them. The battery cover does not "cave" in like my DSi and the insert window around the touch screen is solid--no light shows through. This XL feels as if it is a much higher quality console. \n \n I\'ve played with the regular stylus and the bigger pen type stylus. Either is fine but I prefer the regular stylus. The pen stylus might be good for someone who likes to hold the stylus like a pen but it is not a make or break for me. \n \n The other functions (camera and the settings) worked well. No problems encountered. The charger looks to be the same as the regular DSi and this unit fits fine in my G Pak organizer. Edited to Add: Sound--it is actually slightly better sounding than the regular DSi. It feels as if it almost has a deeper sound. More like surround type sound. Also if you have a regular DSi there is a point when you are adjusting sound where it goes from quieter to regular and almost seems like it skips a step. The XL does not do this -- the sound progression is very good. I put in my Dragon Quest V as the music is very majestic and it felt more like it was enveloping me in the sound than a regular DSi (tested it with my daughters).\n \n Overall I\'m very happy and will update with the weight issue if it becomes a problem. Other than that I\'m excited to go play my games and see them on the big screen!\n'

aS"\nI agree with the other review...this works GREAT! My upper arms have become more and more flabby over the years, and within just a few weeks, I see a shocking improvement. I also do the 6 minute workout daily (because of the positive results, I am very motivated to keep doing it), and mostly while watching tv, since it's an easy routine to remember. I also take it on vacation with me, since it doesn't take up that much room. I've seen the absurd comments about it being suggestive, but honestly, don't most excercises look silly when you're doing them?

aS'\nPretty good sci-fi/action/horror/semi-comedy. Probably a must-have for sci-fi collectors and definitely a must-have for Natasha Henstridge fans. The best parts (and most humorous) are the scenes where Sil (Henstridge) is trying to figure out how to operate in Earthly society. I would have given the show five stars if a couple more such scenes were included in place of some of the slower and/or more predictable scenes in the latter half of the film.\n'

aS'\nI order this product after pre-ordering my iPhone 4 on June 15th.  It was the only case I could find that seems to readily availble to ship from the merchant.  Received the item promptly just a few days before the phone arrived.  It included a front screen protector and a cleaning cloth.  \n \n The fit is pretty accurate and serves the purpose for protecting the sides and back of the phone considering it was likely manufactuered with limited specs available for the iPhone 4.\n \n My only complaint is with the finish - there is a raised seam all the way around the sides (and over the round volume buttons) where it\'s aparent the two halves the of the case were fused together or the injection mold wasn\'t cut properly. And the edges of the open cutouts for the headphone, mute button, dock connector, etc has a similar yet smaller lip around the openings.\n \n A minor complaint with the screen protector that it has that "rainbow" or oily look to it when held at an angle to the room light when the phone is off or on standby.  But viewing the phone directly you can\'t see it.\n \n But for my needs - having a case and screen protector available for the day I got my phone for a inexpensive price - this case meets my needs.  I plan to replace it in the future as other product become available and use this case as a back up.\n \n (Pictures of the seams coming soon)\n'

aS"\nCharles Dickens's acknowledged masterpiece, Great Expectations, is rightly considered one of the greatest novels of all-time. It depth and breadth are staggering, as it follows its protagonist, Pip, from his early childhood through his later life. During the course of his life, we encounter a vast catalog of raw human emotions:  love, hate, jealousy, hope, sadness, despair, anger, pity, empathy, sympathy -- and on and on. The story is treasured and revered for many reasons. One of its main strengths is its plot:  after a somewhat slow introductory section, Dickens puts his story in fifth gear and delivers a fast-paced and exciting story that gallops along without ever losing interest or clarity. The incredibly complex plotline, full of separate stories and incidents that seem totally unrelated to each other, but are then all harnessed together as the book heads straight toward its denouement, is also full of constant plot twists, which continue up until, literally, the last paragraph. But, of course, as with all of Dickens's major works, it is the characters that make the book. Like Shakespeare, Dickens preferred to have the story develop through the characters, rather than having the characters be mere set pieces inside of an overriding story. And what great characters they are:  the perennially paradoxical but essentially human Pip; the bitter and mysterious Miss Havisham; the beautiful and haughty Estella; the simple and saint-like Joe; the kind and benevolent Herbert; the very human convict, Magwitch -- and all of the other wonderful characters. Dickens excelled in creating well-rounded, very human characters who harbored very real and very complex emotions -- that is, human emotions. We identify with Pip as he winds through his life, because we have been there, too -- the disappointments, the surprises, the loves, the anger, the sadness. In whatever way his story may differ from our own, it is still essentially human, as is ours. For all of his complex and paradoxical emotions and sentiments, Pip is a recognizably human character -- and that is why we love him and this book. A masterpiece for the ages, which will endure for years yet to come, Great Expectations is a great book that can be loved by one and all, for, at its heart, is that grain of simple truth that says so much about what is human in all of us -- whether we have great expectations or not.\n"

aS'\nThis is a great book. It\'s not what I expected - in a good way. The quality far exceeded my expectations - 100% full-color and packed with pictures, diagrams, charts, quotes, cartoons, and lots of Glenn\'s trademark "A.D.D." observations. Not what you get in a standard book of political commentary. The Presidential Smackdown is hilarious. But in spite of all that, the information contained in the book is excellent and it\'s presented in a way that makes it easy to understand and helps you see through the so-called "facts" that are being thrown at you from every direction, from media, from government, and from a generally uninformed populace. Highly recommended for anyone interested in liberty and freedom.\n'

aS"\nSome drama films are the kind that you feel emotional resonance for the characters, feel mildly engaged by the plot, think about it for a few seconds after leaving the theater, get into your car, get pissed off at a stupid driver, and quickly move back into your own life. The Lovely Bones isn't that kind of movie.\n \n Director Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings and King Kong fame, doesn't seem like the most obvious choice to direct the adaptation of the seemingly untouchable Alice Sebold novel, but he does his best, by staying close to the source material, but occasionally taking things out here and there. He also brings alot of ah-mazing CGI shots that are so gorgeous, they may be worth the price of admission alone, and I doubt we would've had that type of a movie if anybody else had directed it. However, you get the feeling that Jackson paid too much attention to the CGI aspect, while he could've dealt with the center plot issue with more directorial sensitivity, mocking the same way the book was written, and that's what stops this from being a perfect movie.\n \n The plot centers around Susie Salmon (played by Saoirse Ronan), a 14-year-old girl who is raped and murdered in 1973. Ronan was absolutely perfect in this role. She showed promise in the 2007 film Atonement, where she also played a terrified youth who is dealing with an unbelievable situation. In the film, Susie is watching over her family, the boy she was in love with, and her killer -- from her own personal heaven.\n \n Stanley Tucci nails his role, playing the demented serial killer Mr. Harvey. He gives a particularly chilling, and uncannily believable performance, showing more versatility with every film he makes, you can tell that he really got lost in this role, because his part isn't one of those where you find yourself wondering what the actor has previously starred in -- you see his character, and he does a damn fine job at it.\n \n Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon play Susie's family, and each of those roles require the actor to display quite alot of emotion, grieving her loss, and they all do terrific work, causing you to feel the extreme remorse that their characters do, and I really don't know if better actors could have been selected to play the respective parts.\n \n Nikki SooHoo plays Holly, a girl who Susie meets in heaven, another victim of Mr. Harvey. Her role is particularly memorable, serving as something of a reassuring voice to the Ronan's character, and I see her doing great things in her future, because, while being an unknown actress, she shows just as much talent as the other actors in this all-star cast.\n \n The core of this movie, however, the reason to go and see it in a packed theatre, doesn't lie in its acting, or the writing, or even the direction. It lies in the story. We've all wondered what happens to us after we die. The Lovely Bones suggests that we go to a world that we think is perfect, but we're still haunted by the things that troubled us in our lives. And while the movie leaves you heartbroken, wanting to spend every day you have on this earth as your last, it leaves you pondering your own life, the significance of it, how you'll be remembered. And that's something I particularly like in a film, when it not only moves you to the point where tears are flooding your eyes, but when it leaves you with a great deal of psychological issues to ponder, about your own life, and what comes after your life is ultimately over. And that's what The Lovely Bones does. And while staying true to the source material, that's all a fan of this story can ask for.\n"

aS"\nI did lots of research and comparisons before selecting the ASUS VW246H. Was very worried about getting bad pixels. I chose Amazon who has the best policy. Boy was the choice great!  This monitor has no bad pixels and was perfect straight out of the box.  Can't say anything at all critical about it.  Huge!   Awesome color, clarity, contrast and detail.  Can't go wrong with this monitor or with Amazon. Free shipping to sweeten the deal.\n"

aS"\nI've always been a huge Nora Roberts fan but lately her books, and especially this series, have been lacking... and at these prices I expect a good story!\n \n The characters all feel familiar, the dialogue seems repetitive and the stories lack tension. This book in particular was a difficult read since nothing really happens and the main characters were bland, annoying and have no passion. I had to force myself to finish since mid-way through the book I just didn't care about them or the other too perfect couples. \n \n"

aS'\nI purchased one of these because my husband is an old rocker and his hearing isn\'t as good as it used to be. He\'d given up watching TV on our 46" Samsung LCD because of muddy sound. I don\'t know whether we blew a speaker (which we\'ve done on every other stereo and car we\'ve owned) or whether it was just the tiny, tinny speakers in the TV. (Time out for pet peeve: We paid a LOT of money for this TV 2 years ago; you\'d think they could put decent speakers in it. OK, back in) He was always asking me what people had said. I wasn\'t sure one of these would \'fix\' it, but it did. We pulled it out of the box and plugged one cable into the wall for power and one into the TV for audio (actually 2 together, you know how they do left and right, red and yellow). We turned the TV speakers off and started enjoying TV immediately. Then my son insisted that we had to use the subwoofer. I thought extra noise was part of our problem and didn\'t want to add anything more. We plugged it into power and placed it behind my husband\'s chair. Wonderful. You don\'t actually hear stuff from this, more like you feel the sound. And this woofer is wireless, so other than needing power, you can put it ANYWHERE in the room. Apparently it\'s not like the 3.1/5.1/7.1 speakers where placement is so critical (at least according to those audiophiles). And it only took a few seconds to train our remote to drive it. You hold down a button and count the blinks. When it reaches 3 or something it\'s programmed.\n \n So, easy setup of soundbar, able to use existing remote, and decent looking design. What\'s not to love. \n \n \n'

aS"\nI hate to admit it, but this book really illustrates the poor research and constant mistruths that come from my party.  Coulter is a disgrace to not just the right but America and all it stands for.  Hannity and Colmes should be re-named to the Sean Hannity Show because Alan Colmes simply is not as vociferous as his counterpart and it hurts the left.  I'm Republican but more importantly I'm a proud American.  I would prefer to hear fair and balanced because it is good for public discourse but it simply is not happening and never will. He who yells loudest is usually the one heard.  I was really disheartened to learn the truths about Al Gore and Love Canal, the Internet and Love Story.  Franken illustrates the truth about the lies that were told by the media that negatively affected Gore's run for the presidency.  It is worth buying this book just to read about this alone.  Some that read this review may question my loyalty to the GOP.  At times I do myself.  I simply wish that everyone would put the country first rather than their agenda.  After completing the book I'm a little more than disillusioned with the lies in the media.  We should stand for it no longer.  This is an excellent book for everyone!\n"

aS'\nSo many of the reviews are more about the character\'s actions- I\'d prefer to actually discuss the book.  My sister just started high school, she\'s 15 and she lent New Moon and the first book, Twilight to me.  Despite our age gap (I\'m sixteen years older) I found them a very engaging and entertaining read.  I\'m glad to share these with her and I\'d suggest them to anyone who is staring at a younger, somewhat mysterious female relative wondering what to buy them for Christmas.\n \n The pacing is good.  The book is a quick, satisfying read.  My feeling is that the author works through scenes rather than writing in a linear fashion- and the scenes are fairly cinematic in their structure which I personally like.  She gets to the point in her stories and fits a lot of action and significant detail in without overwhelming you with a density of vision.  \n \n If you\'re concerned about the content, as in "Is this appropriate to give my neice/cousin\'s kid etc" you can be assured that the romantic tension captured here is through restraint rather than exploration.  Not too surprizingly this is highly seductive.  Several reviews seem disappointed by the character\'s actions and have given fewer stars.  However, I\'d like to say that this book is clearly part of a larger work and we\'re seeing Bella at a certain point in her personal growth.  It is not a conclusion novel so it doesn\'t feel like one.  She acts like, well, a confused person in love.  I think the depiction is honest and it is a good thing when a character can annoy or drive you crazy: it means you\'re engaged and the author has done their job well.\n \n I\'ll be honest- I wasn\'t expecting to be drawn in, now I\'m a bit annoyed I have to wait until next fall.  \n \n New Moon is the sequel to Twilight, so I\'m covering both in my review.  I think it could stand alone but I\'d stronly recommend reading Twilight first as it really gives the foundations and \'rules\' of Bella\'s world.\n \n \n \n \n \n'

aS'\nI am a staunch conservative and have been for many years. If you define an independent as someone whose stomach was turned by George Bush and Barack Obama, then I\'m an independent.  Neither of these men know anything about small non-intrusive government or conservative values.  Well Bush is gone now and the menu before us has Barack Obama\'s name on the cover.  I knew the conservative mantra of negatives about Obama before, during, and after election. He had the most liberal voting record of any Senator, no experience running anything, biggest claim to fame prior to government professional was "community organizer", the Tony Rezko connection, Bill Ayres, Rev. Wright etc. etc. blah blah blah. That was plenty enough for me to believe he was eminently unqualified, if not dangerous, as an American President. Been there...did that.\n \n Then I read Michelle Malkin\'s "Culture Of Corruption"  I fancied myself somewhat of a political junkie and as such could not imagine a jaw-dropping political expose.  Wrong again bar room breath.  The book is jaw dropper not just because of the plethora of corruptive associations and activities concerning Obama (and his spouse believe it or not), but the vast depth and breadth of corruption involving his key government advisors, appointees, and friends.  It is so meticulously documented that it also served as proof positive that mainstream media is even more corrupted than I imagined. The proof was out there!\n'

aS'\nLet me say, I LOVE the "Twilight" books.  Like, REALLY LOVE them.  I love to read, and I usually read the classics.  I\'m a Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, Bronte Sisters kind of girl.  My friend insisted for two years that I should read "Twilight", but I kept thinking, "Teen vampire romance?  Not my kind of book."  Finally, this 29-year-old mother of three was on a flight by myself with some time to read, so I bought "Twilight".  I absolutely DEVOURED it--I read one book a day until I had finished the entire saga in four days. Luckily, "Breaking Dawn" had just been released, so I didn\'t have to wait.  The "Twilight" books are my absolute FAVORITE guilty pleasure--I love the fluff, the cheesy dialogue, the LOVE--all of it.\n \n For me, "New Moon" really needed to redeem all that was wrong with the "Twilight" movie.  After watching "Twilight" last year, I was SO disappointed.  Catherine Hardwicke had just taken our beloved series and turned it into a made-for-TV movie.  I laughed at all of the wrong places.  How Bella and Edward fell in love was completely rushed.  I could go on.  Melissa Rosenberg butchered the book and everything that made me obsessed with it.  Sure, "Twilight" was fun to watch because it was "Twilight", but the portrayal was so, so, so wrong on so many levels.  My favorite book had been reduced to lines like "spider monkey."\n \n WELL, "NEW MOON" JUST MADE UP FOR EVERY CATHERINE-HARDWICKE WRONG!  FANS OF THE BOOK WILL ADORE THIS MOVIE.  Edward actually smiles!  The acting was SO much better, the visuals were stunning, and the dialogue was much, much improved over "Twilight".  I honestly didn\'t want it to end.  It stayed so true to the book we all love, and the little additions were perfect.  I really felt like I was watching Bella on screen--Kristen Stewart was spot on.  Every expression, every sad word was perfect.  AND THEY SAID, "I LOVE YOU," something that was blaringly absent in "Twilight".  Chris Weitz has made a stunning, gorgeous film that lovers of the book will adore!  **I secretly wish he could remake "Twilight".  This is what "Twilight" should have been!**  This closet Twilighter was pleased beyond belief.\n \n It seems like most of the critics\' negative reviews have problems with the plot, the story, etc.  Well, if you like the book and, therefore, like the plot and the story, you will love the film because Chris Weitz is true to the book beyond what I could have imagined or hoped for.  This movie felt like it was made for the fans, so I can understand that if you\'re not a fan of the series how it may feel like a laboured effort to watch "New Moon".  But if you love Bella and Edward **and even Jacob--Taylor Lautner was FANTASTIC in this!**, you will leave wanting more!\n \n Chris Weitz for "Breaking Dawn"!\n'

aS"\nI read the 1st book, and purchased this one yesterday, due to being snowed in in NYC I was given a full day of relaxing at home. This book is a fun, light hearted read that makes the time fly by. I am in my mid-twenties, and enjoyed this book. The writing isn't complex, but you have to take the book for what it is. If you enjoy fiction, somewhat chick-lit, you will enjoy this book. It keeps you going, and I read the entire book in about 3 hours. Cute interesting story, touching on some subjects that most girls deal with.\n"

aS"\nThis is the 4th Panasonic vacuum cleaner I've owned in the past 15 years (I have a 3-story home and like to keep a vacuum on each level).  This commercial Panasonic vacuum doesn't seem to have the suction that my previous regular Panasonic models had (or maybe it's the brush roll?) We have several furry pets and I must vacuum the same spot over and over and over to get the fur up...and the results are only so-so.  For the past couple of years I had been using a big, clunky top-rated (by Consumer Reports) Sears Kenmore vacuum on the main level of our home, but as the attachments on the Kenmore would fall apart while in use, I quickly relegated that vacuum to the basement.  It did, however, remove pet hair quite effectively.  Everything else about the Panasonic commercial vacuum is a winner...especially the well-fitting attachments.  I love the longer cord so I can keep vacuuming from room to room.  The unit has the by-pass motor feature, which saves $$$ in the long run.  I would have given it 5 stars if it was better on pet hair.  It is ultra-light weight and very easy to use.\n"

aS"\nWe use cloth diapers, but when we want to use a 'sposie, we love Seventh Generation.  He also has gotten bad diaper rashes from other 'sposie brands, but the Seventh Generation are as kind to his skin as his cloth dipes!  As he's gotten older, wet diapers bother him more, so I'm ordering some Seventh Generations to put on him for nighttime so that I can hopefully start getting more uninterrupted sleep (please, please, God, let this work).  They're definitely absorbent enough to last all night, even on the nights that he spends nursing every two hours.  They're also nice and trim - he's a slender guy, and it's  nice that we can find a good fit that isn't too bulky!\n \n Do I wish they were as cheap as generic disposables?  Absolutely!  But, not to put too fine a point on it, I feel my suspicions about the safety of the products used to make those have been confirmed.  It never fails that after we use them, if we have to borrow a dipe at a playdate or similar situation, my son has a red, sunburn-like rash all over his bottom, which goes away with a little bit of salve and a switch back to Seventh Generations or cloth.  From now until potty training, I'm staying stocked up on the Seventh Generations.\n"

aS"\nThe Culture Warrior by Blll O'Reilly provides a reader with powerful principals for change. It is the first book I have read by O'Reilly and have found his writing to be pleasant.  I found this book to be enjoyable as it describes the most effective people should be value centered, which is the key for long term success.  The book went on to describe where people are dependent and need others to get what they want while independent people can get what they want by their own effort.  The paradigms presented in the Culture Warrior by O'Reilly can assist individuals in their professional work and more importantly in their personal lives. I give this book a thumbs up and a must read.\n"

aS"\nI have read the Twilight Saga and fell in love with the books.  However, the movies leave something to be desired.  I personally liked Twilight better, some of the acting just seemed off to me in New Moon. With this being said, New Moon was my least favorite book in the series so this may be why I didn't like the movie as much.  I have not gotten the chance to watch any of the extra things on the disk so I can't say if it's good or bad.  I would have to say the best thing about the movies are that they picked good looking people and I think that is what pulls a lot of the watchers in!\n"

aS'\nLike many fans out there, you\'re probably wondering what in the world the 1.11 rebuild of Evangelion is considering the 1.01 release is barely four months old.  While FUNimation has confirmed that 1.01 was the beginning of four rebuilt feature film releases, 1.11 isn\'t the second one but rather 1.01 again with some of its lighting (lack thereof) issues addressed, the addition of 2-minutes of new scenes and a second disc including a bunch of extra material.\n \n Hard facts first: The release is comprised of a two-disc set, with the feature presentation now coming in at comes in at 100-minutes with an appropriate PG-13 rating due to animated action, violence and some ambiguous nudity. \n \n Language options are standard sub & dub fair, which means the viewer is given the option of running the original Japanese dialog track or an English dub, either of which is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound. The option to turn on English subtitles exists for either language choice as well. \n \n Extras are quite robust and occupy the entire second disc.  Included: Rebuild of Evangelion: 1.01 (Shiro Sagisu Version, Joseph-Maurice Ravel Version), "Angel of Doom" Promotional Music Video, News Flashes, Movie Previews: Preview 1 - Color-corrected version, Beautiful World Version 2, Beautiful World Version 2A, and Beautiful World Version 2B.\n \n The story, while straightforward enough in presentation, has been the source of case studies, web-site devotion, even college thesis throughout the years and hence could never be summarized accurately (with dignity) here. However, to reduce it all down to its most basic levels, a young boy by the name of Shinji is thrust into a world beyond comprehension once an attacking "Angel" comes to town. It turns out that Shinji is one of few individuals in the world who possesses the rare ability to pilot the massive synthetic beings/ weapons known as Evangelions. \n \n Reluctantly he allows himself to submit to the whirlwind of life-changing experiences associated with becoming an Evangelion pilot and makes some new friends and discovers more about his own past in the process. Working for a top-secret, underground (literally) organization known as NERV, Shingi\'s life as an average 14-year-old is forever lost to the reality that his destiny is to be the one to save all of mankind from imminent doom. \n \n So here it is precisely twelve years since this very material graced Japanese movie screens, you may rightfully be wondering what it is that FUNimation is releasing here. The answer is a bit complex, but I\'ll do my best to set it straight. \n \n Way back in October of 1995, the animated television series Neon Genesis Evangelion made its television debut in Japan. Two years later the work was "rebuilt" into a theatrical release that essentially spliced together the key moments of the tale into a larger, single effort. The mission was a success but kind of like what George Lucas has done with his Star Wars franchise, the creators behind the property always felt as though the technology available at the time wasn\'t quite where they would have liked it to be to accurately present the tale visually. Hence in 2007, the material was revisited once more, this time not simply remastering from the original film stock, but rather breaking the material down into its raw form so as to correct and readjust even the smallest imperfections such as animation density and errant particles as a result of using film. It was not so much an exercise of splicing new CGI effects and eye-candy into the original material as it was about using modern animation methods to perfect the look and feel of the original material. As an added bonus the CG elements allow for visual flair that was, at the time, quite impossible to achieve. \n \n Hence that brings us back to this, the 1.11 release, which is the second official North American release of this rebuilt movie series (it is scheduled to be presented in 4 parts total, with the third and fourth parts being released together). Obviously, part 1.11 represents the introduction to the story. \n \n If the timeline appears confusing, rest assured that sorting it all out is by no means a prerequisite to enjoying the film. It starts quickly with very little time spent establishing back-story and sweeps the viewer into a truly unique world where the precision and color pallet of modern computer generated animation melds seamlessly with the unique look of hand-drawn cells of yesteryear. \n \n Plot wise, the tale is brisk and wonderfully entertaining with battle sequence on the absolute grandest scale broken up by moments of genuine character-development and emotional attachment. Perhaps the greatest of these being the sexual tension that exists between the lead characters or the appearances of the enigmatic father of young Shinji. \n \n Fans, detractors, and scholars alike have gone to great lengths in drawing parallels and comparisons to Evangelion\'s symbolism throughout the years and yet agreement to or even knowledge of these theories is by no means necessary to come away from the film with satisfaction. \n \n In fact, it has actually surprised me in revisiting this film (which is actually made up of the first six episodes of the original television series) at how much of an influence Evangelion has had over subsequent Giant Robot anime franchises like RahXephon and Aquarion. The show is rife with familiar archetypes such as the young boy being thrust into the role of humanity\'s savior, the biomechanical weaponry/ interfaces, the enigmatic villains that refuse to reveal their intentions, the impassive corporation behind it all, and the dysfunctional family structure that makes the antagonist question his very purpose of existence. Evnagelion is essentially the framework from which all others have followed. \n \n The direction is simply wonderful with the structure of the film being more an endless succession of perfectly framed scenes than a random display of visuals. The voice acting is also quite notable whether you choose to enjoy the original Japanese dialog track (which is spectacular by the way) or the freshly dubbed English track featuring the talents of some of FUNimation\'s finest performers. Either option represents the perfect accompaniment to the impeccable visual work. \n \n In all this release marks the beginning of a franchise that has been deserving of revalidation for quite some time. The approach taken with rebuilding the film from the basic elements must surely have been quite an undertaking for all involved but I can attest that the finished product simply oozes with hints of the level of perfectionism sought out in the process. Amazing things are truly possible when such a revered and definitive property receives the loving caress of modern technology\'s capabilities. Considering the asking price of the new build isn\'t much higher than the extra-feature-less 1.01 release, this is the recommended choice.\n'

aS'\nMy wife and I just went to a double-feature. I picked AVATAR and she picked THE BLIND SIDE. Now, there couldn\'t be two movies on a different plateau than AVATAR and BLIND SIDE, but I\'m so glad that she brought me to see this movie. AVATAR, I gave 4 stars, BLIND SIDE, 5 stars. BLIND SIDE, for what it was, was flawless.\n \n With BLIND SIDE, the story tells itself, because it\'s the true story of 2009 Baltimore Ravens Right Tackle Michael Oher, or possibly Michael Williams, or maybe something else, and his improbable escape from oblivion with the love and care of a rich white family in Memphis, Tennessee. Michael Oher\'s greatness, first showed up in his size and athletic potential and then in his courage to forget and go forward. Michael Oher, a kid who struggled at basic study skills and education, but scored a 98% in protective instincts. A tribute to his lifestyle and his ability to survive, homeless, with two shirts, a pain on his face that couldn\'t be explained.\n \n Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, and I haven\'t seen a whole lot of nominated movies this year, but if she isn\'t at least a runner up to the best actress of the year, I\'ll be stunned. This was Sandra Bullock\'s shining moment. She is strong and she is funny and she is exceedingly brilliant at hiding the tears she sheds throughout the movie as her personna won\'t allow her to be seen crying. No scene was more poigniant than the one where she makes a bedroom for Michael in her beautiful home with a chipperness that you would expect from a spunky Tennessee mother. Michael says, "I\'ve never had one of these before." and she says, "What, a room?" "No, a bed." he says. She looks at him, stoned faced, gives a quick nod and exits the room, enters the bathroom, locks the door and although we don\'t see it, we know exactly what she\'s doing.\n \n THE BLIND SIDE is a testimant to what life is all about. The Tuohy families link to Michael Oher may have been a rare occurence, and that\'s why there\'s a movie about it, but if we all looked out for each other a little more, despite color boundaries, despite class boundaries and just showed a little love and extended a helping hand when we could, the world would be a better place.\n \n The Tuohy\'s didn\'t just extend a hand, they extended their hearts and lives.\n'

aS"\nI have had the Samsung BD-C5500 Blu-ray player for about a week now and I absolutely love it. It was very easy to setup and worked perfectly right out of the box. It's smaller in size than the DVD player it is replacing but noticeably heavier. It starts up quickly and loads Blu-ray discs quickly too. The buttons on the front of the player are touch sensitive and don't give the user any tactile feedback so sometimes it's hard to tell if you have pushed them or not but at the same time they are cool and have a cutting-edge appeal. Some people have mentioned that they don't care for the remote but I find it to be very adequate and easy to use. I like the larger size of the buttons since I have big hands. The remote seems to work well at different angles and distances as well. When I first hooked up the player it did a firmware update and about a week later it notified me that there was a newer firmware and again did an update. It's comforting to see that Samsung is actively working to improve the device's firmware by releasing updates frequently if needed. I didn't know what issues/features the firmware updates were addressing because the UI on the player doesn't really tell you but Samsung does list what the firmware updates change/fix on their website. The device didn't have any problems connecting to my home network using a CAT-5 cable. It doesn't bother me a bit that this player doesn't support wi-fi out of the box. In my experience wi-fi is very susceptible to interference from other devices such as microwaves, cordless phones, and other wi-fi routers so using it to stream a high-definition movie could be problematic when you decide to pop some popcorn during the show or if someone calls you on your cordless phone. You'll always get better streaming performance from CAT-5. Plus, it's a lot cheaper than the players that do have wi-fi built in.\n \n I have used this player to stream Netflix content from my Netflix instant queue. Before having this player we watched a lot of Netflix streaming content on our computer but watching it on the HDTV using this player has been a lot more convenient and sounds better on the home audio system than on the computer speakers. Streaming works very well and I haven't seen it skip frames or stop to re-buffer the stream. It takes a little longer to buffer the stream at the beginning of playback than my computer does but after a 15-20 second wait it's good to go so it's not a big deal. I have spoken with people who stream Netflix through the PS3 or XBOX and they have told me it takes about the same amount of time to buffer on those systems and I would imagine other Blu-ray players that stream Netflix would have similar performance. Some of the Netflix streaming content will stream in 720p resolution which looks and sounds great. One thing to note is that this player will only see titles you have added to your Instant Queue on the Netflix website. You cannot use the player to browse for different content and add it to your queue. This has not been very bothersome to me but it might bother some people. I actually like the fact that I can put titles in the Instant Queue for my children to watch and they can't browse around Netflix on the player and find adult content accidentally in the process.\n \n Streaming music through Pandora has been great too. The Pandora app works well and has a good interface. You can give songs a thumbs up or thumbs down but only while the song is playing. It would be great if you could go back through the list of songs that have recently played and give them the thumbs up or thumbs down after they have played like you can on the Pandora website but that's not the way it works sadly. The quality of the audio seems very good and the time it takes to buffer the music is not even noticeable. We have really enjoyed having a device capable of using Pandora connected to the home audio/theater system.\n \n I used the Blockbuster service to rent a movie for my kids. The video/audio quality was excellent and I had no streaming problems but the price was a little absurd. The movies cost about $4 to rent and you only have access to watch the movie for 24 hours from the time you first start playing it. At that price I would expect that you would get to watch the title as much as you want for 5 days just like you would do if you physically rented a movie from a Blockbuster location. I don't think I will be using the Blockbuster service very much unless there is a movie I really want to watch and I'm too tired/lazy to physically go to a Blockbuster and rent it.\n \n Overall I feel like the device does a lot for how much I paid for it and is definitely worth the money. I have already recommended it to numerous friends and co-workers who have been looking to get a Blu-ray player. This is the first Blu-ray player I have owned and might possibly be the last since it's so feature-rich and works so well.\n \n Update 4/14/2010:\n \n I have had this player for over a month now and I have received 4 firmware updates I think. With the firmware updates the device has only gotten better. The updates didn't appear to add any new features but they have made the player more stable so it is less likely to freeze-up or stop working in other ways. Everything has been working flawlessly for me.\n \n There is a new service called Vudu now that this player supports. I have not tried to use it yet but it appears to give you one free HD rental so that you can try the service. It looks similar to the Blockbuster streaming app. Most movies appear to have options to rent/buy the title in 3 different formats. HDX (1080p 5.1 Surround), HD (720p 5.1 Surround?), and SD (Standard Definition 480p and I'm not sure on the audio). I have watched a few trailers on Vudu and they stream fine but I haven't tried actually streaming a movie from Vudu yet.\n"

aS"\nI bought the 855 as an upgrade to my StreetPilot C550.  I was reluctant to buy it, based on the less-than-stellar reviews on here, but after using it for a week, I have no complaints at all.  Maybe that's due to the fact that I'm upgrading from the ancient 550, and not the 7X5 series.  The other reviewers are right, the on/off switch can be awkward, and you need a fingernail to push it over to the left.  But that is such a minor complaint, in my opinion.  Also, some people say they like the smoother refresh that the 7X5 series has, and this is more jerky, as you move along your route.  Well, you're not supposed to be watching it when you're driving anyway.  Oh, and it only has 500 waypoints, compared to 1000 on other models.  I'll be lucky if I use 100.\n \n What makes this GPS so remarkable is the voice recognition!  I feel like I'm using Star Trek technology.  It rarely has any problem understanding what I tell it.  Hands free GPS navigation!  I never have to pull over to type a new destination (or try to do it while driving).  I can't imagine any of the minor complaints offsetting the awesomeness of the voice recognition.  Now that it's available, I wouldn't have a GPS unit without it.  If your budget allows for a voice recognition GPS with 1000 waypoints, an improved on/off switch, and smoother screen refresh, then by all means get that one.  But if you're looking to spend about $300, and want voice recognition, do not hesitate to buy the 855.  I wouldn't exchange it for a non-voice recognition unit that has those features that this one lacks.\n"

aS'\nThis hardcover book is a compilation of retro posters of kittens and other animals, most with phrases, like, "I wuv you," and some repeating, "Hang in there."  The poster art in this book reminded me of the genuine heartfelt effort put into handicrafts some friends and lovers give each other, especially early on in a relationship.  Those who appreciate cuteness and whimsy will enjoy this book.  This is a great comforting book to give to a friend, relative, or signifcant other particularly when they are sick, feeling down, and/or adapting to a stressful situation.\n'

aS'\nLife is far from normal for Bella Swan during her senior year of high school. True, her life is full of drama and boy troubles, but for Bella who sees herself as a danger magnet life holds much much more. Edward Cullen, her ever-handsome boyfriend who just happens to be a vampire, breaks her heart when he leaves after Bella receives a near-fatal paper cut at her eighteenth birthday party. Realizing that his family no matter how determined to avoid human blood, can within seconds be overwhelmed with tempation and violence leads him to place Bella\'s safety ahead of his own desires. To say that Bella is devastated is an understatment, she becomes zombie-like in her loss, a fact which is finally realized when Bella and one of her friends are watching a Zombie movie. "It wasn\'t until almost the very end, as I watched a haggard zombie shambling after the last shrieking survivor, that I realized what the problem was. The scene kept cutting between the horrified face of the heroine, and the dead emotionless face of her pursuer, back and forth as it closed the distance. And I realized which one resembled me the most. . . But it was ironic, all things considered, that, in the end, I would wind up a zombie. I hadn\'t seen that one coming. Not that I hadn\'t dreamed of becoming a mythical monster once--just never a grotesque, animated corpse. . . It was depressing to realize that I wasn\'t the heroine anymore, that my story was over." (106) But Bella\'s story is far from over. Reintroduce into the picture, Jacob Black, the young man who first shared with Bella the fact that she was falling in love with a vampire, this new friendship reenergizes Bella\'s existence and gives her a reason to continue on. But is her friendship with Jacob any safer for her than her relationship with Edward was? Or is Jacob hiding a dangerous secret of his own? Is Edward out of the picture for good, or will he make a comeback to try to reclaim her heart?\n Stephenie Meyer\'s novel NEW MOON, sequel to TWILIGHT, is an exciting read, and one that I highly recommend.\n'

aS'\nI must say after reading all the great reviews, this was a mature disappointment.  If you like a lot of profanity, maybe this movie is for you.  However, we could only watch the first 45 minutes, then was disgusted and shut off the DVD and watched TV.  This is definitely not a family comedy.  I prefer comdedy done is good taste, and felt this has none.\n'

aS'\nThere were many reasons I decided to purchase a Kindle - my hands ache when holding a book open, I get headaches from reading stuff on the computer, I wanted something I could throw in a bag and take anywhere, and it holds so many items that I don\'t have to carry three or four novels with me in case I\'m bored or finish one.  Nothing could prepare me for the actuality that is Kindle.  It integrated seamlessly into my life.  If I\'m at the desk, it\'s beside me; if I\'m in the bedroom, it\'s on the nightstand; I even take the silly thing to the john.  It\'s so much easier than a book.  \n \n I expected it to be a little awkward at first, but it really *does* get lost in your hands.  Suddenly, you look down after a couple of hours of reading, and realize you\'ve been holding it all along and forgotten all about it.  I expected to read novels and blogs on it.  I never expected to be able to download all the .pdf technical manuals that I constantly have to weed through on the computer.  I work effortlessly now, looking at the computer, working through a segment, picking up the Kindle, searching for what I need in the manual, even highlighting it, or putting a note in the manual about how well it works.\n \n Note taking is my big thing.  When I\'m looking at a book, I always find note-taking to be an instinct I have to avoid.  I see it as a destructive process.  I don\'t want to ruin my books.  Further, who can really concentrate on what they\'re reading with a pen in their hand?  It\'s two different mindsets.  Yet, with Kindle, I do just that.  I read a segment, I find a passage, I underline it.  I have an opinion, I drop in a note.  A question equals another note.  When I don\'t understand something, the dictionary is right at the bottom of the screen to define the word or teach me how to pronounce it; or I can surf to the web and find exactly what I need.\n \n It\'s so much better than surfing the web on my phone - and far more practical.  For one thing, there\'s no charge except battery power (no pun intended!).  For another, all of my research is in one place.  The book, notes, websites and highlights are all together - as they should be.\n \n I know a lot of people complain that it should have a bright screen so that you can read it at night, or that it should have color.  I say - nay!  The main *strength* of Kindle is that it reads *exactly* like a book.  No eye strain.  No having to turn away every few minutes to relax your eyes; or ending a session of reading with a headache.  No "hot lap" or mousing around to find the right page.  It\'s just like a book.  You hold it, you turn the page, it\'s effortless, you forget it\'s there.  Only what you\'re reading matters, and that\'s exactly how it should be.\n'

aS"\nThe Clash of the Titans remake is not as bad as some are saying and the movie is quite enjoyable, I think in 2D or even on DVD it would have been a lot better. I love the new 3D digital movies that are being made at the moment but this was a real mess. I understand that it wasn't shot in 3D and was therefore converted afterwards, what were they thinking about ? The picture was awful and in most scenes it looked as though someone was standing behind the main actors. After seeing the true 3D magic of Avatar I was really disappointed. I think I will purchase it on DVD and hopefully the picture will look better on my 42in screen that it did in the cinema. I don't think I would watch a converted 3D movie again as it just cheapens the expierence. I would have given it 4 stars but the let down of the 3D only rates it 3 stars.\n"

aS"\nAfter getting divorced at age 40, Nina Askew moves into an apartment and plans to get a puppy to keep her company.  Instead she ends up with Fred, a smelly and depressed beagle/bassett hound cross.  Fred is instrumental in her meeting her downstairs neighbor, the ER doctor Alex.  They are meant to be together, but Alex and Nina both think the other party won't be interested because of the age difference - Alex is ten years younger than Nina.  The characters are likeable, especially Fred, but the book was rather predictable.  At the end there are some easily-resolved misunderstandings thrown in that seem to be there just to make the book reach the 200-page mark.\n"

aS"\nI like to think of myself as an independent thinker. This book does a great job of breaking down some pretty big problems with government and society. If you are a parent or younger than 40, I finished the book with a bit of different perspective. I actually am not a fan of Mr. Beck, never seen his show. However he does seem to make some very valid points, especially about the economic troubles facing our nation. So, it's a fast read and if you are open minded, it's interesting and does make common sense.\n"

aS'\nNow that I\'ve had the EB1501 integrated into my home theater for a few weeks, I thought I would update my review of it.\n \n I have this connected via HDMI to receiver, surround sound and a 52" HDTV. Due to the limitations of my setup (not the EB1501), I do not use HDMI for sound, so I will not say anything about the box\'s ability to carry both signals properly.  If you use S/PDIF for audio, you are going to appreciate the included adapter (works great).  I was going to use Boxee or XBMC, but I don\'t like the hassle of setting up and integrating Tv tuners into those, so I am using Windows 7\'s Media Center.\n \n The EB1501 is EVERYTHING I have been looking for in a HTPC.  It runs (very) cool and (very) quiet.  It\'s barely noticeable yet attractive enough to not have to hide - which makes it easier to get to the DVD drive, power, ports, etc...   The computer is stable and a workhorse for this task.  \n \n With the Atom processor, I wouldn\'t recommend trying to do too much gaming or heavy multitasking.  As a component in a home theater, this thing runs circles around the almost useless Media Center Extender I was using before.\n'

aS"\nPrior to reading this book, I knew little about either Sarah Palin or Alaska and I was interested to learn more about both, especially the book's author. Although famous in America, Sarah Palin could go just about anywhere in Britain completely anonymously as long as she didn't meet any Americans along the way. Frankly, Brits normally only take any notice of American politicians if they become president. There are exceptions such as Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, but they are rare. Contrast the number of reviews of this book posted in Amazon USA with the number posted in Amazon UK for confirmation of the lack of British interest.\n \n I realized early on in this book that I was going to enjoy reading it because Mrs Palin's story is both interesting and well-written. She makes summer in Alaska sound wonderful, although acknowledging that the winters are long and harsh. She discusses many aspects of her life and it is clear that she has strong views on a number of issues. \n \n Although not directly relevant to her political career, perhaps the most intriguing question about her beliefs concerns her stance on the origin of species. At first glance, Mrs Palin appears to be a full-blooded creationist, but she denies this. Apparently, she accepts what she calls microevolution, in which species change and evolve over time, but not that people are related to apes or monkeys. Her stance is interesting, but I prefer to accept Darwin's theory, despite the proof of it still being incomplete.\n \n Not having studied the American political scene closely, I'll leave others to judge the accuracy of the main story, but the politics as described here is explosive stuff. Corruption in Alaska, tales of in-fighting within the Republican party and dirty tricks played by some Democrats - all rather sad, but I'll say straight away that similar things happen elsewhere in the world including Britain. Hey, the summer of 2009 was dominated by the expenses scandal at Westminster, while all British political parties of any significance have had their internal fights at one time or another, in between playing dirty tricks on each other. So in one form or another, most of the political stuff here doesn't surprise me, but some of it is shocking nevertheless.\n \n An unconventional politician in many ways, Mrs Palin nevertheless appears to have brought about significant changes in a number of areas in her home state of Alaska, which may seem to many people (especially in my country) like a frozen wasteland, but which is rich in natural resources and occupies a vast land area, approximately equivalent to France, Spain, Italy and the UK combined. So being governor of Alaska is not equivalent to running a small local council in Britain even though it is sparsely populated (fewer people live there than in the county of Leicestershire in which I live). I suspect that the position of state governor may be equivalent to being leader of the Welsh assembly. The biggest Alaskan story by far in my adult lifetime was the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, which Mrs Palin covers briefly; she later had plenty of political fights with the oil companies (including BP as well as ExxonMobil and others) in her time as state governor.\n \n Mrs Palin has drawn plenty of criticism from a variety of sources and uses the opportunity that this book affords to hit back at those critics, often explaining how things have been distorted by the media. Having had my own relatively minor experience of being in British national newspapers, I have sympathy with victims of media distortion, so I don't blame Mrs Palin for hitting back via this book, but I can see that others will react badly. At least my story was a one-day wonder with no lasting consequences, but things are different for those who go into politics, sport or showbiz.\n \n Mrs Palin clearly isn't impressed by the way the Republican presidential campaign was handled, and clearly feels that she wasn't able to contribute effectively to the campaign, but the aftermath was even worse. While some Republicans were happy to cast her as the scapegoat, some Democrats launched a sustained campaign against her that exploited freedom of information laws. Ultimately, this created problems for the legislative process as well as personal difficulties for the Palin family, all described in detail, causing Mrs Palin to decide that she had to quit as governor with a year still to run, even though she was never found guilty of anything. As she acknowledges, that decision to quit may kill her political career, but Mrs Palin says that she did what she felt was right for Alaska. Inevitably in such situations, people will believe whatever they choose to.\n \n I expect Mrs Palin will return to public life in some capacity eventually. That might be as a presidential candidate, but it might alternatively be as champion of a cause dear to her heart. Her vice-presidential campaign generated enormous hope among disabled people, while her love of Alaska makes her passionate about environmental issues. So there's two obvious issues, but I'm sure there are others.\n \n Would I vote for Mrs Palin, given the chance? I don't know because I'd need to know more about issues not discussed in this book, but I'd like the option.\n \n I can see why this book - and the author - are so controversial. Fans of Mrs Palin will love this book, while critics will be furious. Both are likely to have their opinions reinforced by reading this book. Coming from a position of ignorance, I'll just say that I found this book to be compulsive reading.\n"

aS'\nAlready being an owner and user of two different camera types, DSLR and film, I felt I was missing out on the point and shoot category.  So, I researched upcoming cameras in June and heard about Panasonic\'s new Lumix lineup and didn\'t wait any time to pre order this guy.  It is very compact (smaller than a deck of cards) with a serious range 8x zoom.  Just be sure you want a camera that takes all the manual control of picture taking before you buy it.  There is almost no manual settings, other than choosing which "scene" you think your shot will be.  Panasonic has some fun settings - Pin Hole, film grain, and the key word that people love "High Dynamic" mode, which is their attempt to create a High Dynamic Range type of shot.  They also have an underwater setting, for those who will later shell out the money for the casing to take this baby in the pool or some other form of wet.  The Leica name on the lens is what got me looking at panasonic cameras, and as far as I can tell, its a fine lens.  It is no DSLR, but it is a great incognito camera.  \n \n Video is Average, but I wasn\'t really concerned about it.  -- When I say average, I\'m comparing it to video I\'ve seen taken from a camcorder.  The HD component is nice, but you\'d need to be still holding it and hope whatever you\'re filming is not moving too fast for a great recording.\n'

aS'\nIf I\'m going to spend more than a hundred bucks on an item or somewhere around there, I do extensive research first to know I got the best bang-for-the-buck and, consequently, dodge any potential future buyer\'s remorse. \n \n I\'ve realized that the time I spend doing my product comparisons is often time that others don\'t have so I may as well share what I can. \n \n I\'ll start by saying that you\'ll see my "Verified Amazon Purchase" on the Flip HD Ultra Camcorder review because, obviously, that\'s the one I wound up buying and I\'ll share with you why. But what I like in a camcorder may not suit your own needs so I\'ll break it down and let you decide what\'s best for you via what I found out: \n \n Here are the pocket camcorders I compared: \n \n Flip UltraHD (will be referred to as "F") \n Flip Mino HD 2nd generation (Will be referred to as "M") \n Creative Labs Vado HD 8 GB 2nd generation (Will be referred to as "CL") \n Kodak Zi6 Pocket HD (Will be referred to as "K") \n \n Why HD cameras only? Brighter colors and better images, wider images \n \n \n \n HD SHOOTING TIME: \n F: 120 minutes. \n M: 120 minutes \n CL:120 minutes \n K: 25 minutes with batteries they included, 120 minutes if you buy an SD card \n \n MEMORY: \n F: 8 GB \n M:8 GB \n CL: 8 GB \n K: internally only 30 MB recording space but it has 32 GB expandable SD/SDHC card slot. Because it comes with such small recording space you really need to buy an SD or SDHC card to maximize its potential, but the potential is really good and this will increase your ability to shoot longer. \n \n \n RESOLUTION: \n All 720p which is excellent, just one step below the top 1080p format. \n \n MICROPHONE: \n F: Stereo \n M: Mono **Update** They are now putting Stereo Mics in the Minos as of 2010.\n CL: Mono \n K: Mono \n \n SOUND: \n F:Premier AAC audio. Best stereo sound quality but still not great in winds \n M:Good sound quality. Still not good in winds. \n CL:Poor sound quality; had issues with sound and picture not being in sync. \n K:Poor sound quality \n \n \n ZOOM: \n F: 2x \n M:2x \n CL:2x \n K: poor quality zoom on the one I tried but I still think it\'s 2x. It has a great macro focus for very close-up objects if, for example, you see a bumble bee and want to shoot it on a leaf a few inches away! Kinda cool. \n \n CAMERA SIZE AND WEIGHT: \n F: 4.3x2.2x1.2 4 oz \n M: 3.9x2x0.6 3. 3 oz \n CL: 3.9x3x0.6 3.5 oz \n K: 5.5x2.5.0.9 5.6 oz \n \n SHIPPING SIZE AND WEIGHT: \n F: 6.2 x 3.1 x 3.1 inches ; 11.2 ounces \n M: 2 x 0.7 x 3.9 inches ; 1 pound \n CL: 3.3 x 7.9 x 6.3 inches ; 11.2 ounces \n K: 4x 5x 2.5" 2.4 lbs \n \n \n TECHNICAL DETAILS: \n F: USB cable pops out of the back so you don\'t need to keep up with a separate cable. Comes with Flip Video rechargeable AA battery pack (recharges when connected to USB); also supported by standard AA batteries. Note: Some sets come with the HDMi mini included and others come with the rechargeable battery pack on Amazon. Looks like one or the other but of course if you need both you can buy the other. \n M: USB cable pops out of the back on this one as well. Has child safe button to prevent accidental deletion of videos. Internal lithium ion battery recharges through built-in USB arm \n CL: USB in camcorder. Included in box are HDMI cable (nice), USB extension cable,(nice)silicon skin (cool) & rechargeable battery. \n K: Included in box are HD and AV cables and wrist strap and rechargeable batteries and battery charger. Has built in USB arm. \n \n SPEED: \n F: 30 frames per second. \n M: 30 frames per second \n CL: 30 frames per second \n K: choice of 30 frames per second or 60 frames per second. \n \n VIEWING SCREEN: All 2" except the Kodak was the largest at 2.4" \n \n \n IMPORTANT NOTES: \n F: Best low-light performance for the mini cameras (though not perfect at all) and least amount of blurring and dropped frames in my opinion. Best color. Only one with stereo sound. You can get an underwater case for this one! Though that may sound crazy for a Texan, we use the camera non-stop on vacations and even when we aren\'t IN the water, we are around the water...on boats, in the sand with sea mist, etc. Then we can dive in and record the fish. Comes preloaded with flipshare software...just plug in to computer and it pops up. Only one with stereo sound.\n M: Colors don\'t appear as good on the Mino as the other cameras. Thinnest camera. Make sure you get the one that only comes in the color aluminum or brushed metal. If it comes in any other colors it is the 1st generation MinoHD and they improved upon that one in the newer models. Great audio. Better shooting in low light than most mini cameras. Camera comes preloaded with FlipShare software. Can get still images through flipshare software. \n CL: Decent filming in low light but not nearly as good as the Ultra or Mino; Software is preloaded in camcorder. \n K: This is the only camera that I compared without the built in image stabilizatin which corrects for shaky images. What appears to be metal in picture is actually a chrome colored plastic. That said, this had the largest viewing screen of all of them. 2.4" Very poor in low light and seemed to have far more shaking and blurring. It also takes still pictures but they are really really poor quality...same as a lesser-quality cell phone pictures but good in a pinch if you want a still shot and have no cell or camera I s\'pose. Heaviest for a pocket camera. Software is not preloaded in camcorder but a cd comes with it. \n \n \n HOW CNET\'S EDITORS RATED THE CAMERAS: \n F Excellent \n M Excellent \n CL Very Good \n K Very Good \n \n And, finally, the reviews of the Flip from experts swayed me quite a bit: \n Fast Company: "Flip Ultra HD is Pure Digital\'s "Best Pocket Camcorder Yet." 6-09 \n \n USA Today: "New Flip Ultra Video Cameras Might Flip Your Switch" 4-09 \n \n Business Week: How do you Invigorate a Recession? Look to i-phone, Flip, Kindle, and Zip Car For Answers \n \n There were lootttts more I came across when researching the Flip Ultra HD but those are some of my favorites. \n \n \n \n CONCLUSION: Clearest picture and sound was important to me, expert reviews that pointed to the Flip UltraHD as well and I liked the built in software and the case I can get to shoot underwater. It is the number one selling camcorder as well. So that was my personal decision-making process. However, keep in mind that if you need reading glasses none of that will matter if the 2" screen is too small for your viewing the shots easily for playback in which case you may wish to get the Kodak if that\'s important to you.. \n \n Also: No matter which one you get, you will probably want a mini tripod if you ever want to be in the shot yourself do don\'t forget those. \n \n Also note: It\'s confusing because when these manufacturers make changes in the camcorders, they do not change the names on the new versions, nor do they change the names if it\'s an HD version or a non-HD version so be sure you look for the "HD" after the brand name and look for "2nd generation" or "newer version" on the Mino and Vado if you like one of those better so you don\'t get the older models. \n \n \n Hope my obsessive comparing and contrasting for my own purchasing assistance helped you as well even if what you wanted in a camera was different from me. :-) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n'

aS'\nI received the Mr. Beer kit for Xmas, and it\'s a good system overall. It serves as a very good introduction to home brewing, but it does have some downsides as well.\n \n Good bits:\n -The system is about as easy as it could be.\n -The instructions are clear and simple.\n -The fermenting tank is small (2 gallons), meaning that you don\'t have to wait around for a long time to taste the final product. With your more normal 5 gallon kits, you have to bottle a LOT of beer, and wait a bit longer for fermentation.\n -There\'s dozens of mixes available on their homepage, and they offer a lot of quality products at reasonable prices. Join their club to avoid the expensive shipping charges.\n \n Not so good bits:\n -The fermenter is almost too simple. A proper airlock design would make it more foolproof as to tell when fermenting is complete, as well as avoiding contamination of the beer.\n -The included mixes, while of good quality, produce a rather poor beer by comparison to what it is possible to make with the kit. Their website has a lot better product than what they include in the kit, and this gives some people bad impressions of the kit itself. The fault is not with the kit, but with the very basic starter beer in the package. The separate mixes they sell in stores are not much better, being all very basic brews. They\'re not bad, but they\'re not great either. Mediocre at best.\n -Sterilization (which is possibly the most important part of home brewing) is difficult because the fermenter is not dishwasher safe. A higher quality plastic that could stand high temperatures would be a better overall choice for the fermenting keg, since automatic dishwashers are a great way to sterilize your equipment easily.\n \n My suggestions on how to use this kit correctly:\n -Go to their website and pick up some of the more advanced receipes instead of using the mixes as given initially. If you\'ve used those included mixes, don\'t be disappointed overall, it\'s that the mixes are very basic. Using the better receipes and the better ingredients, you can make quite incredible brews.\n -Keep the fermenter in an enclosed dark space during the fermenting process. I recommend a large cooler. This avoids contamination of the product as well as keeping it at a steady temparature.\n -Be very, very careful to sterilize completely. The OneStep cleanser they include is very good, but you do have to use it properly. Read the instructions and be sure that everything gets cleaned extremely well.\n -No matter what the instructions say, bottle conditioning takes longer than a week. Really. Wait 2 weeks, preferably 4, before you crack the first bottle. The beer only gets better the longer you let it mature in the bottles.\n -Go easy on the sugar. Too much sugar in the bottles and they will explode, or taste like cider.\n \n If you use the kit as intended and with a careful eye for cleanliness, then you can produce some excellent quality brews in a very short time. But follow those instructions precisely. Anything less will result in poor quality brews.\n \n ----\n After using it for over a year, I have some more things to add:\n \n - DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN THE LID. The lid must allow the gases produced MUST escape. This is especially true with their higher alcohol mixes and stouts. If you overtighten, the end result will be spilled beer and a ruined keg. I brewed a dopplebock using the keg, and overtightened it. Result: The keg overpressurized and almost burst. Some foam came out of the top of the keg, and spilled into my cooler. The residue, once it dried, provided food for.. well.. not so nice creatures. The keg was naturally unusable afterwards. However, this was my own fault, and a new keg only cost me $10 through the Mr. Beer website, so it was not a total loss. And the beer (since it was not contaminated due to the pressure differential, I bottled it anyway) turned out to be absolutely spectacular. So whatever you do, don\'t tighten it too much. A little hand pressure for tightening is enough.\n \n - Again, go easy on the sugar when bottling! Somebody told me that they had one of the plastic bottles burst on them and the remainder tasted like cider. This is the result of excessive sugar in the bottling process. I highly recommend you get the sugar measure that they sell, if you are bottling in the 12oz, 22oz, or 1 liter sizes. The sugar measure is very easy to use and exact in nature. Takes out the measurements and guesswork.\n \n - Finally, I do not recommend normal bottles with a capper. These are difficult to use and contrary to popular belief, do not produce better beer. The screw top bottles are simplest because they hold the pressure in properly and are trivially simple to use. Alternatively, Mr. Beer sells 16 oz "Grolsch style" bottles on their site, which are the rubber grommeted wired cappers, and they work very well. If you must bottle with glass, get those. Or go find similarly capped bottles of beer and use those bottles (after dishwashing, of course). Glass is much easier to sterilize because it\'s disahwasher safe. Just take the rubber caps off first.\n \n'

She can be sexy, sultry, emotional and funny.\n Her acting is underated and the movie itself is excellent.

aS'\nI have been a major Sookie Stackhouse fan for years.  I began reading Charlaine Harris\'s series, then called the Southern Vampire Mysteries, since before book four came out, and have read them all in order.  I was puzzled when I found out that HBO was going to make a TV adaptation of it.  Why this particular series?  Why not Laurell K. Hamilton\'s Anita Blake series?  (It would have been suitable, what with all of the sex and all.)  There were others as well, like Kelley Armstrong\'s Women of the Otherworld and MaryJanice Davidson\'s Queen Betsy series -- all of which have the erotic tones that HBO would have loved.  So why this book series?  Now I know why, but more on that later.\n \n I very much enjoyed season one.  It was very faithful to Dead Until Dark, except that small characters like Tara and Lafayette were expanded, and you get everyone\'s point of view, not just Sookie\'s.  Also, Bill has more depth here, and you see things from his point of view, and you understand him better.  Other storylines were added, like the emphasis on "V" addiction, which makes sense.  Season two has taken things to a whole other level and I love it so far.  I can\'t wait for the blu-ray release!  From the very beginning, the show has very sexually explicit scenes, most of which centered on Jason\'s exploits, and some violence as well, with a great deal of emphasis to vampire hatred as the new form of southern racism/segregation.  Season two takes things further, with gore and horror replacing the sex (there\'s still plenty of it though), and the fledging out of characters like Eric, Tara and Lafayette (whose death does not happen in the TV series).   MaryAnn is the mysterious creature that makes a brief appearance in Living Dead in Dallas, but is expanded on the TV version to the point that she almost takes over the entire show.  Jessica, Bill\'s "daughter," puzzled me at first.  What\'s the purpose to this character?  But I like her now, especially after Hoyt becomes her love interest.  And I love the emphasis on vampire makers, like Lorena and Godric, the latter of whom moved me almost to tears in the last episode that he\'s in (plus, the actor who plays him is totally hot).  I don\'t want to ruin it for people who don\'t have HBO and have to wait for the DVD or blu-ray release, but, in spite of the departures from the books, it\'s better than season one.  \n \n The actors are great.  Ann Paquin has grown on me as Sookie, British hottie Stephen Moyer is wonderful as Bill, and I finally like Alexander Skarsgard as everyone\'s favorite vampire bad boy Eric.  I am also enjoying Sam Trammel (Sam Merlotte), Rutina Wesley (Tara), Nelsan Ellis (Lafayette), Michelle Forbes (MaryAnn Forester) and Ryan Kwatten (Jason Stackhouse).   I am also enjoying the actors who play Andy Belleflour and Hoyt for the comic relief they supply.  (Andy is hilarious as the drunken out-of-work cop who witnesses the orgies and general odd behavior and no one believes him.)  All in all, if you\'re a big fan of the books, then you won\'t want to miss this show.  No boring moments throughout the hour-long series.  I cannot wait for season three and season two is not even over yet!  And I see why HBO decided to adapt this particular book series.  They must\'ve seen the potential for character development and the southern setting on the small screen.  Great job!\n \n'

aS'\nAs an avid user of smartphones, for years I\'ve completely ignored a series of dull, uncreative phones running windows. While a variety of hardware form factors, some even technically superior to the competition, have come out, the software continued to look incredibly boring compared to the iPhone, Android, and even Blackberry. The main selling points consisted of "It runs windows and has a start button like you\'re used to on a computer" and "We have Office and sync with Outlook!". While these may have appealed to some business customers, the consistently shrinking market share of Windows phones demonstrated their lack of appeal to consumers as the recent smartphone boom hit. \n \n With the HD2 this trend may finally be coming to an end. In conjunction with HTCs beautiful Sense interface, some aggressive hardware, and some genuine innovations, the HD2 is a Windows phone I can actually use and recommend. Let\'s start with the pros and follow up with a few drawbacks. \n \n **Hardware**\n \n -The 1ghz Snapdragon processor coupled with 448mb of ram is blazing fast. This is the fastest speed in a phone currently available. The HD2 loads everything quickly, and can run multiple apps at the same time. You can feel how fast the phone runs by playing with it for a few minutes. Gone are the sluggish Windows Phones of old, constantly running out of memory and crashing. The HD2 is fast and has top notch hardware and you can feel it. \n \n -The screen is huge: 4.3 inches and stretching from corner to corner. The Resolution at 800x480 pixels means you\'ll see much more on that big screen than average. That means more room for icons and that sexy weather display on the main screen. \n \n -The HD2 supports 3g on T-mobile, including the upcoming higher speed 3g. This means the fastest downloads and best call quality available. Note: the phone does NOT have ATTs 3g bands and the 3g will not work if you\'re using it unlocked on ATT. \n \n -5mp camera with auto focus and 2 LEDs. 5mp is the highest we see on most phones, and the camera looks great. Having not 1 but 2 LEDs for flash seems a bit silly but works well. The phone even comes standard with a little flashlight app for a blindingly bright way to see in the dark. \n \n -Included 3.5mm jack - this is becoming standard on most phones, and it\'s great to see it on the HD2. This allows you to use standard headphones without an adapter when playing music or listening to the built in FM Radio.\n \n -Included wifi, bluetooth, and a hardware (real) GPS for turn by turn directions round out all the bells and whistles included in the phone. \n \n -Battery life is similar to most smartphones. You will easily get a day\'s use without having to charge, but most likely you\'ll have to plug it in at night. \n \n **Interface**\n \n -HTC Sense is what really makes the phone shine here. This part of the software is done by HTC, not Windows, and runs on top of standard Windows Mobile 6.5 professional. HTC Sense expands on the previous TouchFLO 3d interface and enhances the way customers interact with the phone. Sense creates the beautiful Today screen, animations for messages, social networking features. It also lets you interact with the phone in unique ways, such as pinching to zoom. Some of these features are so close to the iPhone that Apple has recently filed lawsuits against HTC. \n \n -The home screen is customizable, though not quite to the extent of Android phones. It lets you place a few apps on the screen, along with a beautiful standard weather app that detects your phone\'s location and shows the current time and weather in your city. \n \n -Touch is a much better experience on this phone than previous windows mobile phones. The screen is capacitive, meaning it uses touch instead of pressure. No awkward stylus or pushing is needed for the touch to work. The phone responds quickly and smoothly to any motions. \n \n -Basic phone features like placing a call or sending a text remain simple, with big buttons on the main screen to do so. \n \n -Typing on the touchscreen is a breeze due to the size of the screen allowing for a bigger keyboard. As someone who has often stuck to phones with hardware keyboards due to inaccurate screen keyboards, I found typing on the HD2 much easier than previous touchscreen keyboards, although still not as easy as using a hardware keyboard. The HD2 also includes the new SWYPE interface, which lets you type by dragging your fingers through all the letters of a word instead of tapping each one. SWYPE was surprisingly accurate in typing the correct word and will even learn new words once you type them manually. \n \n **Included Apps and Accessories**\n \n -This phone is being marketed as a media phone, and includes several media apps to demonstrate that. MobiTV lets you watch what is essentially Cable TV on your phone free for 30 days and then ten dollars a month after that. Blockbuster lets you rent or buy movies for your phone. Barnes and Noble eReader lets you purchase ebooks. \n \n -The phone comes with a huge 16gb MicroSD card out of the box. This is the biggest memory card available currently, and gives you plenty of room for pictures, videos, music, and apps. The best memory card pairs perfectly with the best processor and screen, and it\'s great that HTC did not hold back on this extra. \n \n -Full videos of Transformers 1 and 2 are preloaded on the memory card. These videos look great and show off the beautiful screen. Note the movies do take about 4gb of space on the memory card. \n \n -The phone comes with a gel skin in the box to protect the phone, which you would have to buy separately on most phones. \n \n **\x10Drawbacks**\n \n -Price is the number one concern here. The phone is priced higher than competing smartphones. This price seems justified, however, due to the cutting edge hardware in the HD2. It also comes with some nice accessories you\'d have to buy separately from other phones. Upgrade and new customer deals will certainly lower the cost for those buying from T-mobile. \n \n -The app store is another drawback. The good news is that the phone has one, the bad news is it\'s the smallest of ANY smartphone operating system. As of this review the Windows Marketplace carried less than 1,000 applications, compared to Android at 20,000 apps and iPhone at a staggering 150,000 apps. Even Blackberry, Palm, and Nokia carry more apps than Windows. You are also going to find significantly more paid than free applications for Windows Mobile apps. The Marketplace is simply far behind that of competing phones, which for a heavy app user will diminish the enjoyment of the HD2 by quite a bit. \n \n -Windows Mobile 7 upgradeability is still up in the air, but it currently looks like this phone will NOT be getting an upgrade when the new OS is released. The phone does not support some key hardware feature (front buttons) that WM7 requires, and therefore it is unlikely to be upgraded. The upcoming OS promises to be very exciting, and the fact that this beautiful phone will probably not receive the upgrade is disappointing. \n \n Overall this phone is fast, pretty, and offers top of the line features. The phone feels solid (and huge) in your hand, while the software is fast, works well and is fun to use. If the HD2 is any indicator, Windows Mobile may become a legitimate competitor in the smartphone market again. The phone seems to be selling very well, with T-mobile selling out almost everywhere the day the HD2 was released.  I\'d recommend this phone as a viable alternative to Android and the iPhone.\n'

aS'\nFirst things first, you must assemble this bike yourself.  I had abit of trouble with the bike, brake positioning, gear settings, and ect.  So reading the manual and making sure everything is aligned properly is a must.  The only down side I found to this bike is weak tubes.  My advice is buy a decent pair with your order, and higher quality brakes if you live in the green mountains.\n'

aS"\nI am a conservative economist who, like many of the reviewers here, never voted for Bill Clinton.  However, unlike those same reviewers, I read this entire book.  I must say that it is somewhat satisfying to understand the thought processes behind this president.  He is a remarkably bright individual who overcame a somewhat deprived childhood to excel at some of the world's finest educational institutions.  Given the ineptitude of the current administration which won on pedigree, it is refreshing to know that hard work, intellect, and perseverance can also lead to the White House. The book has a few tedious moments.  The Arkansas campaigns are littered with the names of individuals no one outside of the Ozarks will recognize.  On the whole though, this book delivers for the aficionado of American politics.  You will see the deep thought and debate surrounding policy decisions.  You will appreciate the fact that this president actually led his administration with his own ideas and strategies for implementing them.  Likewise, he wrote many of his own speeches and routinely held press conferences without knowing the questions in advance.  I would have liked even more from these areas, but the book does provide as much depth as most political memoirs. What I would like from Clinton's second book would be a discussion of the perception and reality of American politics.  For example, the Bush administration, with annual budget and trade deficits of over $1 trillion, has the most liberal fiscal policy since the Johnson administration.  At the same time, they have increased the size of the government more than any other administration in history, with the effects of the war and 9/11 accounting for only 45% of this enormous growth.  Clinton, on the other hand, was extremely conservative during his second term, shrinking the government, slowing the growth in expenditures across the board, and balancing the budget.  Yet, Clinton is reviled as being too liberal by conservatives who don't seem to do their homework.  It's too bad they're unwilling to spend time reading a book like this instead of allowing radio talk show hosts to fill their heads with lies that matter.\n"

aS'\nI first read this book when I was 16, and I\'ve received a lot of Dianetics auditing since then. I also re-read it twice. However, I never had my own copy (used friends\') so I decided to pick up my own book from Amazon today. \n \n I was shocked to see the vast morass of negative reviews on this book! It seems to be a whole bunch of people who are biased against Hubbard and Scientology in general. They obviously have limited comprehension of the material because their reviews seem to have more to do with their opinions of Hubbard and Scientology than they do of Dianetics.\n \n I personally have had a lot of fun with Dianetics therapy and I believe I\'ve improved myself a lot, too. After reading this book I was practically itching to try it. Since then I\'ve had dozens of hours "in the chair" both auditing and as a preclear on Dianetics. The book makes it easy! Plus, the edition I had gave you a "how-to" card which laid out all the steps for you in summarized form. I can only hope this newer edition has the same thing. \n \n It\'s likely my review won\'t even be read by many, as the first several pages of reviews are all negative. However, if you\'ve slogged through them because you believe someone MUST have had something nice to say about it - take a chance on this book. I and many of my friends will vouch for it in a heartbeat.\n'

aS'\nOther reviewers have rightly observed that, although THE HELP is a rollicking good story, it lacks depth, nuance, and a good editing. The characters are, indeed, caricatures. I encourage everyone who has praised this book to take a few minutes to read William Faulkner\'s short story "That Evening Sun." Faulkner says more in a few pages about black domestics than Stockett says in 444. And he says it beautifully.\n'

aS'\nI am really enjoying my new Roku XR.  The setup was extremely easy and intuitive.  I am running the ROKU XR wirelessly off of an N-Router (Trendnet 633) located on the other side of the house.  I am getting "4 dots and HD" (best quality) with no interuptions in play.\n \n My only complaint is that I have to go to Netflix and enter movies I want to watch on the Netflix Instant Queue before the Roku XR will play the movie.  So basically, I have to go to my computer, find my TV shows or movies, enter them into the Instant Queue on the computer then goto the ROKU and my selections will be available to watch.  I really wish I could scan for movies and shows thru the ROKU.  \n \n Other than that, the setup and playback quality is excellent using HDMI. Recommended :)\n \n UPDATE 6/10/10 :  ROKU and Netflix have fixed the annoying need to select your movies on your computer and then go to the ROKU to see your queue.  Now you can search for movies on Netflix from inside the ROKU.  BRAVO!!!\n'

aS'\nSo I am hugely overweight, and just had a baby. I thought that I would give this video a try, and I LOVE it. I am still on the level 1 work out, but am getting better every day. I can now do the whole 30 minute level 1 work out. Next week I am going to be adding level 2. In only 2 1/2 weeks I have lost 14 inches and 12 lbs. Now I still have 80 to go, but it is a good start. Bob does the level 1, and he keeps me motivated thru the whole work out. Right when I think I am about to die, he starts counting down, and tells me I can do it, and I believe him. Rather than sitting on my couch hoping the Biggest Loser comes and casts me, I decided that the more logical option would be to bring the biggest loser trainers to me. I would recommend this to everyone, from those who only have 10 lbs to lose to people like me who have 50+.\n'

aS'\nIn this short but informative, thought-provoking book, Nicholas Carr presents an argument I\'ve long felt to be true on a humanist level, but supports it with considerable scientific research. In fact, he speaks as a longtime computer enthusiast, one who\'s come to question what he once wholeheartedly embraced ... and even now, he takes care to distinguish between the beneficial & detrimental aspects of the Internet.\n \n The argument in question?\n \n - Greater access to knowledge is not the same as greater knowledge.\n \n - An ever-increasing plethora of facts & data is not the same as wisdom.\n \n - Breadth of knowledge is not the same as depth of knowledge.\n \n - Multitasking is not the same as complexity.\n \n The studies that Carr presents are troubling, to say the least. From what has been gleaned to date, it\'s clear that the brain retains a certain amount of plasticity throughout life -- that is, it can be reshaped, and the way that we think can be reshaped, for good or for ill. Thus, if the brain is trained to respond to & take pleasure in the faster pace of the digital world, it is reshaped to favor that approach to experiencing the world as a whole. More, it comes to crave that experience, as the body increasingly craves more of anything it\'s trained to respond to pleasurably & positively. The more you use a drug, the more you need to sustain even the basic rush.\n \n And where does that leave the mind shaped by deep reading? The mind that immerses itself in the universe of a book, rather than simply looking for a few key phrases & paragraphs? The mind that develops through slow, quiet contemplation, mulling over ideas in their entirety, and growing as a result? The mature mind that ponders possibilities & consequences, rather than simply going with the bright, dazzling, digital flow?\n \n Nowhere, it seems.\n \n Carr makes it clear that the digital world, like any other technology that undeniably makes parts of life so much easier, is here to stay. All the more reason, then, to approach it warily, suspiciously, and limit its use whenever possible, since it is so ubiquitous. "Yes, but," many will say, "everything is moving so fast that we\'ve got to adapt to it, keep up with it!" Not unlike the Red Queen commenting that it takes all of one\'s energy & speed to simply remain in one place while running. But what sort of life is that? How much depth does it really have?\n \n Because some aspects of life -- often the most meaningful & rewarding aspects -- require time & depth. Yet the digital world constantly makes us break it into discrete, interchangeable bits that hurtle us forward so rapidly & inexorably that we simply don\'t have time to stop & think. And before we know it, we\'re unwilling & even unable to think. Not in any way that allows true self-awareness in any real context.\n \n Emerson once said (as aptly quoted by Carr), "Things are in the saddle / And ride mankind." The danger is that we\'ll not only willingly, even eagerly, wear those saddles, but that we\'ll come to desire them & buckle them on ever more tightly, until we feel naked without them. And we\'ll gladly pay anything to keep them there, even as we lose the capacity to wonder why we ever put them on in the first place.\n \n Most highly recommended!\n \n'

aS'\nI purchased this player to replace a Samsung BD-P2500 that was giving me major compatibility problems with Blu-ray discs, and so far haven\'t been disappointed.  Picture quality on Blu-ray is stunning and I\'ve had no compatibility issues thus far; upscaling on standard DVDs is great. VieraCast is a novel feature that could someday find greatness if Panasonic expanded support to include Amazon, Netflix and Hulu. (I understand Amazon support is on the way.)\n \n I have not experienced the freezing issues that some describe here, but I think that\'s due to how I use the player more than anything else. (I watch a disc or two at a time, then power the unit off between uses - for a technical explanation of why this apparently sidesteps the problem, see the next paragraph.) In any case, I\'ve read online recently that Panasonic has finally figured out the cause of the freezing issue and is now working on a firmware update to fix it.\n \n (For you techies out there, here\'s a bit more detailed explanation of the freezing issue, based on what I\'ve gleaned online: Blu ray discs make heavy use of Java, and the BD60 apparently has "garbage collection issues" that cause the freezing.  Powering the unit off periodically clears out what\'s in memory, minimizing the likelihood of another freeze-up. Since I tend to watch one or two Blu-Ray discs at a time and then shut the unit off for between uses, I haven\'t experienced any freezes.)\n \n The only other quirk I can report is that while the unit does support 24fps playback on DVDs, you have to switch it on manually every time.  Kind of a pain, but only a pain if you\'re a video purist.\n \n That\'s it.  No other issues.  Sorry for the boring review, but this player just does everything that it\'s supposed to without complaints.  I consider it one of the best A/V investments I\'ve made in a long time, and would recommend it to others without hesitation.\n'

aS"\nThis is a superb product. First- unfortunately Amazon does not have the best deal. You can get it at Target or Walmart for $20. That being said, this is easy to do at work- I am able to pick it up and use it while I'm reading or doing other things that wouldn't require my hands. Like the commercial says the difference for this weight is that it is using small muscles unlike weight lifting that bulks up your arms. If you have trouble with neck or shoulders you may want to use caution with some of the exercises just like you would if you went to the gym. Doing an exercise you haven't done before should be done with caution and if not done properly could result in an injury. This would be unlikely with the shaker weight but in my opinion anything's possible. Also note-this does not shake on it's own- that is the point of this product that you use your muscles to make it shake. There are reviews on here that gave poor ratings because they thought it was motorized or something- well, I would say if you don't want to work out and actually use your muscles then you can save yourself $20 and do not buy this product:)\n \n It is a great inventions and the science behind it makes sense. I have seen results and I recommend it to all my friends and coworkers. \n \n \n"

aS'\nBefore i start let me just tell you "what\'s New" with the iPod touch Third generation" :  \n  \n -Faster Cpu/Double the ram/Better graphic (faster Boot time/faster loading is all what i did notice) \n -Double the storage for the same old price \n -Voice control (I\'ll explain it in a second) \n -Latest firmware for free \n -New Earbuds with built in remote+Microphone (So you can use voice control) \n  \n And that is everything~ depends on your needs upgrading from 2G to 3G might be not worth it. \n  \n *Important Note* : only the New iPod touch 32GB/64GB are third generation ~ (8GB is repacked 2G) Details below. \n  \n About the new Voice control function, if you love to take your iPod with you to the Gym the new feature "Voice control" is pretty cool, it does allow you to control your music via your voice, no need to get the iPod out of your pocket you can simply say "Next" to move to next song, say "shuffle" for shuffle , say "Pause" and music playback will stop etc, that is why i recommend the iPod touch over iPod classic for gym users, my friend bought an iPod classic and now he complains that the iPod classic is too heavy for him when he goes to the gym and he will have to buy another iPod "properly Nano" for his Gym, for me i use my iPod touch for the gym, it\'s so light that sometimes i forgot that it\'s even in my pocket.   \n  \n After playing with my iPod touch 3g for a while i honestly did not notice any difference from the outside or the inside compared to my old iPod touch Second generation (It\'s supposed to be faster but i did not notice anything during music and video playback or the menus, however browsing with safari and loading facebook was faster, same thing with boot time), you properly can only notice it being faster with heavy applications since video/music playback is already fast enough with 2G. \n  \n I got the 64GB iPod 3G for [...]$, if you think of upgrading your 2G iPod touch honestly do yourself a favor and save yourself the money unless you really need that much of a storage (I do that is why i bought one), also remember that the 3G battery lasts less than 2G,(3G battery = 30 Hours of music playback versus 2G 36 hours of music playback according to apple official specs) \n  \n *VERY IMPORTANT* for the people who wants the new 8GB version, the new third generation 8GB iPod touch is NOT 3G it\'s a second generation iPod touch but apple did repack it/renamed it to 3rd generation, which seems to be misleading by APPLE and it\'s not cool at all, it is IPod Touch 2G+Updated firmware and that is it. \n  \n The iPod touch 3rd generation 32GB/64GB versions comes with a free mic+remote with the earbuds while the 8GB do not (it comes with normal earbuds), the 32GB/64GB have the New CPU+Graphic (According to apple the new cpu is twice as fast just like the iPhone 3GS) while the new 8GB use the same old CPU/Chip from the old iPod touch second generation. \n  \n Here is APPLE description on the iPod touches page about the 32/64GB versions : """Enjoy all the great features of the 8GB model along with better performance, richer graphics and voice control"""  \n  \n The iPod touch 3rd generation is the same awesome iPod touch second generation was. \n You can play your music/watch your videos/play games, even read your kindle books/etc "you can read amazon big description of what it\'s capable of if you do not know yet, it\'s better than what would i say because it has pictures and everything. \n    \n The iPod touch got the best browser i have ever seen in a portable device, i do not even need to carry my netbook with me anymore thanks to my iPod touch, if you hated browsing with lame browsers that crash a lot or slow (many mobile phones) trust me on this one, the iPod touch browser is not a toy or a gimmick it is a browser you can depends on, it\'s super fast and smooth and after using it for like a full year it has only crashed on me once! \n  \n Short list of pros and cons about the iPod touch \n  \n Pros: \n -Slick,small and light device \n -Great touch screen \n -The BEST web browser on a portable device \n -Amazing video/music playback \n -App Store (Too many cool applications for Free) \n -Display screen is clear and bright \n -No bugs and annoying stuff a very reliable hardware \n -64GB Flash based mp3 player\n  \n Cons: \n -Not much of an upgrade over 2G (people were disappointed because they did not get upgrades like camera/OLED/etc) \n -Weaker battery, only lasts 30 hours for music playback versus 2G iPod touch 36 Hours music playback \n -Expensive for the 64GB version \n -Still no FM radio without the use of online applications \n -Bluetooth is still half locked\n \n Update : one more reason to avoid the 8GB ipod touch, Apple announced today "April 09 2010" that iPhone 4.0 OS will be released this summer and it will bring many new features to the iphone and ipod touch, however some features like Multitasking will only be available for iphone 3GS and higher or Ipod touch third generation and higher (As i said before the 8GB is second Generation only, a third generation 8gb ipod touch do not exist! so you wont be getting multitasking if you buy the 8GB ipod touch),  \n \n I hope my review was helpful :)\n'

aS"\nI have a smaller PC compressor in the shop that is very LOUD, so expected this one to be as well, especially since some of the other reviews found it so. But it's not much louder than the two-stage oillube compressor it replaced. I needed something that could be moved in a pinch, something that could run off 110V 15A service I have in the garage, and something with enough capacity to run my air ratchets, cut off tools, etc. I bought this unit fully expecting to have to wait for it to catch up occasionally, but it's kept up just fine.\n \n The only complaint I have with the unit is the difficulty of reaching the drain cock at the bottom of the tank. Next spring when it warms up I might replace that with an Ell and a ball valve. It also draws the full 15 amps, so plug it into a run that nothing else is pulling from.\n \n Overall I'm very satisfied with this unit.\n"

I can print 6 slides per page, and all printing can be double sided, even multiple pages per side! Amazing paper saving options. Also, a very helpful automatic on-screen error guide.

aS"\nFirst of all, I couldn't even play this game--given to me as a gift--on my computer because it ran excruciatingly slow. It took all of 45 minutes just to create a decent sim that I eventually gave up on it--a big blow to me after I had uninstalled all of my Sims 2 content from my computer to make space for this game. Granted, my computer isn't exactly the newest, so I won't fault EA for this problem.\n \n So I was incredibly excited when the friend who had given me the game invited me to her house to play her copy on her computer. I played for all of 20 minutes, and then stopped.\n \n Create-A-Sim is probably my favorite part of the Sims series. I was extremely disappointed in this feature on the Sims 3. In the Sims 2, I enjoyed how the sims' features could be cartoonishly distorted to create some very unique sims. In the Sims 3, they all look the same to me. Pudding faces and muddy hairstyles. I was also highly disappointed in the selection of hairstyles and clothing. The color customization of all items and the traits feature was pretty neat, but that's about it.\n \n Most of all, I loved the feeling of being God in the Sims. That all  the actions, relationships, etc. of every sim was dictated by me. I became attached to my sims because I knew that their failures and successes were dependent upon me. I felt like that was ripped away from me in the Sims 3 with the new Story Progression feature. Even though this option can be disabled, from what I have heard households and relationships are not as they were in the Sims 2. I would hate to become attached to a sim I've created and have them suddenly move away.\n \n I certainly hope EA can fix some of our concerns in upcoming expansion pakcs. For now, I think I'll re-install the Sims 2.\n \n \n"

aS'\nSimple Plan\'s second original CD, "Still Not Getting Any . . . " gives its legion of fans no letdown after the long wait for the second CD.  If anything, it is an improvement on the first.\n \n   Fans at their shows have already been introduced to "Welcome to My Life" and "Shut Up!", both good, catchy songs just packed with the adolescent angst that is SP\'s trademark.  "Shut Up!" in particular, shows the band\'s knack for combining downbeat lyrics with upbeat tunes, in a song which I interpret as a teenager\'s thoughts while being lectured by his parents.\n \n   Something\'s changed a bit from the first CD, and that\'s the band\'s perspective.  Many of the songs on "No Pads, No Helmets, . . . Just Balls" had the perspective of a teen complaining about a poor relationship with a parent.  There\'s still a bit of that in songs like "Me Against The World" and "Shut Up!", but this time, more songs talk about a romantic relationship gone bad (for example, "Perfect World", "Everytime" and "Thank You"), and the perspective is more young adult than teenager--"Everytime" talks about the partner waking the singer at 3 a.m. and driving to dawn--not likely if still living at home.  The band\'s characters are maturing, as is their music.\n \n   Other notable songs include "Crazy", a throwback to Reset\'s (the predecessor band to Simple Plan) socially-conscious songs, and "Jump", plainly intended as a concert song but very strong in its own right.\n \n   Perhaps the strongest song on the CD is "Untitled", a downbeat song with downbeat music, the dying thought of someone who doesn\'t know why he\'s dying, and despite the people around him, is dying utterly alone.  The sadness which runs through many of the band\'s works is here in full strength.  Softer than usual and using a piano (shades of "Meet You There" on the first CD), even if never released as a single, it may well be the band\'s best song to date.\n \n   While lead singer Pierre Bouvier did almost all the singing on the first CD, much more is heard from backup singers Sebastien Lefebvre and David Derosiers do a lot more of the singing here, and they are well worth listening to.\n \n   Extras on the DVD or flip side (depending on edition) include the video for "Welcome to My Life" and the program (shown, I believe, on MTV) about its making.\n \n Highly, highly recommended.\n \n'

aS'\nAshlee Simpson is the girl who got caught lip-syncing on SNL, so her CDs must not be very good, right? \n \n Wrong. \n \n After all, everyone from KISS too Evanescence have admitted to using backing vocals live.

aS'\nThis review could be summerd up in a short sentence: You are looking at the current killer appliance for personal entertainment. But  I never, ever, do short reviews... So here\'s the long story. Grab a cup of coffee, as this review answers questions you never knew existed.\n \n I have to admit that there have been few items that have captured and kept my enthusiasm for as long as the iPod Touch. Two years ago, I purchased the original Touch, last year I upgraded to the 32 GB, and now I have the 64GB version. Was the upgrade worth it? And what are the things yet to be imroved? Because even though the Touch is close to perfection, there are still many small things that can be improved.\n \n Hardware\n Physically, the new (64GB) Touch is identical to it\'s 2nd generation brethren. It\'s polished crome backplate is slightly curved, making it fit your palm perfectly. As before, the fact that it\'s made from polished chrome will guarantee that it attracts fingerprints and scratches almost magically. I\'m no friend of any kind of protective covers, and my last (32GB) Touch had to live in my pocket with my keys, coins, and other stuff I threw in with it. After a year, the backplate did pick up a lot of scratches, and I expect that the 64GB to fare no better. Personally, I would have preferred a brushed finish for the backplate. This may have caused problems with the readability of the customized engraving that Apple applies to the Touch on the backplate for no additional charge (a nice \'touch\' that becomes increasingly important as the Touch becomes more ubiquitious). This custom engraving you can only get if you order the Touch through Apple (it\'s also not available in the Apple Stores).\n \n The front plate is made from one of the most impressive glass enhancements I\'ve ever seen. After a year of heavy abuse, my old Touch\'s glass front has not a single scratch - not one. I don\'t know how Apple does it, but this is really impressive. Remember, I don\'t use any protective covers or films. The screen itself is brilliant, bright, and can easily be read outside, wich is a feat in itself. The Touch has an ambient light sensor, so it can dim the screen when the surroundings are darker. \n This time around, the screen\'s color temperature has remained unchanged (the 2G shifted all colors from a blueish to a more golden tinge). Movie playback is simply astonishing. The image is crisp, and the on-screen controls natural. Again, there are niceties such as double-tapping the screen to change aspect ratio, or placing bookmarks etc. You still can\'t set a movie\'s contrast, but beyond that small issue, movie playback is perfect. Viewing movies on the Touch simply works great, but personally I think that the screen is too small to watch a full movie. Last week, I tried watching a TV episode while on a plane enroute to Hamburg (a 75 minute flight), but quickly decided against it, opting instead to play a game of \'Luxor\'. Somehow I prefer a larger screen for consuming video, while I have no problems doing something interactive on it. Still, video plays great on the Touch.\n \n Button and interface lay-out has remained the same from the last generation: volume controls on the left side, top holds the \'exit/on\' button, buttom has dock and phones connectors, and the front holds the single home button. There is one thing that can be improved here: I would have preferred the audio connector to be on top (or either side), as the current configuration precludes the use of many applications (e.g. News- and eBook readers) when you want to place it upright -- for example in the Gym. Some apps do use the accelerometers and can be used positioning the Touch upside down, though. \n \n The built-in speaker is unchanged from the last version. It\'s weak, tinny, mono, produces horrible sound, has no volume to speak of -- and yet it\'s one of the best additions to the Touch (the original didn\'t have it, the 2nd gen did). It simply makes casual gaming so much more fun. I don\'t care about the bad sound quality, I just love the fact that it\'s there. \n \n The signatory white earphones that Apple sells with the Touch may look good, but I don\'t like them. In my ears they are too uncomfortable. Since I\'m no audiophile, I can\'t comment on their audio quality other than that it\'s good enough for me. Anyway, I replaced them with my favorite non-Apple version. The hitch here is that Apple now delivers the 64 GB (and 32 GB) with earphones that sport a built-in mic and remote. And my head phones don\'t have that. While the remote is nothing much to write home about (the way it works is just too complex), the mic works well, and has just the right fidelity to pick out voice over the background noise. So, for now, I keep the white buds with me in case I want to use the IP-telephony capabilities.\n \n Battery life appears to have been reduced somewhat from the 2nd gen - at least on paper. During the past few days the new 3rd gen Touch certainly performed as well as or even better than my 2nd gen - but then again, that one\'s battery is already one year old. One fact that I\'ve become very fond of is the quick-charge ability, which works really well.\n \n The built-in wireless connectivity is really nice, with astonishingly well executed integration. The touch does all it\'s wireless networking over WiFi and Bluetooth. WiFi works really well (especially here in Switzerland where Hotspots are particularely dense), and Bluetooth integration (which I tried on the 3rd gen for the first time) is flawless. WiFi reception (range) lags somewhat behind that of a Wintel laptop (no doubt due to the metal backplate) and is pretty much on par with that of a 15" Macbook Pro (which is also somewhat lacking in WiFi reception range). WiFi is still the \'g\' variant though [interestingly enough, the built-in hardware does support 11n, but so far Apple has chosen not to activate it, presumably to conserve battery. This is interesting also from the fact that in the 2G Touch, Apple initially included Bluetooth capabilities, but only activated it with a later OS release. Perhaps the same can be expected for 11n]. Bluetooth now also works with headphones and BT-based car integration kits (works well in mine). I would have loved to try out BT-based printing from the Calender or Addressbook app, but hit a snag: it appears no Touch app supports printing...\n \n Missing Hardware\n There is some hardware that I expected, or whished that it was included in the Touch - especially as (some) of them are now present on other iPods:\n No camera. I was somewhat ambivalent about this. No camera means no pictures and/or movies. But it also means that I can keep handling it rough, as I do not have to worry abou the lens. Also, I don\'t have to worry about taking it to the Gym (my Gym has very strict rules towards camera-equipped items). All things being equal, the addition of a camera (still and/or video) would have been nice, but I don\'t miss it much (truth be told, I yet have to use the camera on my mobile phone).\n Unfortunately, there is also no built-in mic. This is much a more significant omission than having no camera. The Touch is a first class audio voice recorder and (more importantly for me) a first class Skype client. There are third party solutions for this (a mini-micro that directly plugs into the headphone connector), but if the touch had a built-in mike, it would make using world-class applications like Shazam (and Skype) so much easier\n Likewise, there is no compass, nor a GPS receiver present in the touch. I understand that these are left out to better differentiate the Touch from the iPhone, but I would have welcomed them in the top-of-the-line (64GB) version of the iPod.  \n And, finally, there is no radio receiver. I\'m definitely not a radio man, as I next to never listen to it. Still, some people do (as the ton of nicely selling IP radio applications shows), and anyway, the Nano has it now - even with a nice Tivoesque pause feature! Why not the Touch? Strange design choice.\n \n \n iPod & iTunes\n The original iPod\'s strength was the sheer brilliant ease of use - and the touch-based interface represented a mile-stone in improving on that. To date there simply is no better multimedia interface than that of the Touch/iPhone. It\'s natural after just a few seconds. It\'s drop-dead beautiful, with muted highlights, and cleverly accentuated by small (if flashy) animations that convey the different metaphors of the interface (e.g. the rubber-banded bouncing when you reach the end of a playlist). Like no interface before you can instantly use it to accomplish even complex tasks with just the flick of a finger. Using it is sheer, unadulterated fun. The \'Coverflow\' album browsing may be one of the least useful, but it\'s definitely the most natural (and fun) way to flip though you music. And it is jaw-droppingly well executed (note: when you use coverflow you should make sure that you have installed the all cover art from any music you did not purchase from the iTunes Store).  \n At the base of all iPod music playing is the Playlist, and using playlist on the Touch is a joy. The interface whileplaying is also mature, offering niceties such as displaying a song\'s lyrics on a single tap, along with singularily simple controls for repeat and shuffle play. Unfortunately, this playlist feature also still has one of the most glaring shortcomings: the Touch is unable to play playlist groups. I usually group a small bunch of songs into very short playlist (e.g. \'10 best Springsteen\'), and then mix these playlist into larger ones by simply dropping a playlist into a group. Although iTunes supports this, all versions of the Touch have stubbornly refused to do that.\n Also somewhat strangely missing on the Touch is the ability to search for an Artist or music title. Considering the fact that more than 10\'000 songs fit onto the device the need for an ability to search for something would seem obvious (note: the Touch *does* have a global search function, which will also turn up songs - along with contacts and mails that match your search phrase. Having to leave the iPod app simply to look for a song is against everything Apple\'s ease of use is about, and it\'s not what I would expect). And while we are at it, I\'d love the ability to also search the lyrics, but that would be the icing on the cake.\n What is present, and what continues to amaze me is a function that I initially dismissed as some way to sell song: Genius Playlists. What it does is that given a song it finds other songs you already possess that would play nicely together. Since I have lots of songs (else I wouldn\'t be purchasing the 64GB), this feature has helped me to get an incredible amount of additional joy out of my music. There are lots of gems hidden that mass of music I never knew I owned. Of course, if you want to, Genius will also recommend songs you don\'t have but can buy right now on iTunes. That, of course, is the \'sell song\' angle. But at least it\'s incredibly well executed (and yes, I\'ve used it) \n The 64GB now also supports voice recognition - and I\'m sure it\'s a marvel of technology. But (much like the auto-correction system for text) it mostly only works in English. If you have set your system to German, you must pronounce english band names as they would be read aloud by a german-only speaker. Do it once, and everyone in the room stares at you. You\'ll never do it again. Plus, due to the greater complexity of the german language (I am german speaking), the commands only work half the time. A nice idea, and a boon while driving or typing. But *only* when set to english.\n \n Rounding out the audiovisual feature set is the Touch\'s photo presentation ability, really showcasing the touch-based gesture interface. It was the pinch and flick gesture that originally sold me on the Touch, and it still does today. On the Mac, iTunes ties into iPhoto\'s image management, greatly facilitating the task of sorting out which images to synch to your iPod (on windows, this task is slightly more pedestrian, as you\'ll have to manually manage the \'My Pictures\' folder). A strange quirk, though, is that during synch iTunes seems to downsample your images to a (to me unknown, but definitely) smaller size. Since I\'m a photo nut (shooting with DSLR) this \'feature\' annoys me somewhat, as iTunes currently does not provide any means to control the downsampling of photos.\n \n The success of the original iPod has left some competitors scratching their heads, while it is blindingly obvious to most users: the tight, seamless integration with iTunes. Now in version 9, iTunes has become somewhat complex and not always that intuitive to use. It now also tries to manage Photos and Movies as well as Music and Applications. But iTunes is still very easy to use, and synchronizing the iPod Touch with iTunes is quick and simple. A small disappointment is the fact that you still can\'t synchronize your Touch wirelessly, and that it still refuses to mount as an external disk. Another disappointment is that although iTunes now allows you to share your music over the net with multiple Macs, it can\'t stream your Music to the Touch (A small, brilliant app from the AppStore can do this for you, though).\n \n And while we are speaking of iTunes - there is one feature that I\'d love to have on the Touch: the visualizer. iTunes\' visualizer is really beautiful, and I would have loved the same functionality on my Touch.\n \n \n Internet\n While by itself the iPod Touch is an impressive and fun device, it comes into real swing when connected to the internet. The always-on nature and graceful handling of connection drops make the Touch one of the best internet devices I\'ve used to day. The included Safari internet browser performs great - unless you try to load Flash-based content, which is not supported. The email client works great for receiving and viewing mail. Writing anything but the shortest of email is annoying, as the Touch is simply too small for comfortably entering any significant amount of text. Calendar and Address Book are well executed (even if entering a new date and merging multiple calenders is slightly more convoluted than necessary). Mail, Calendar and Addressbook can (if you have that service available) synch live to either mobile me (which Apple loves to sell you) or Exchange (which your employer loves to force on you) through a feature that is very similar to \'push\' notification. In the past, using Exchange has been somewhat spotty, and mobile Me has had it\'s own share of problems. All in all, though both work nice, and exceedingly quick. You do need to be in range of a hotspot for this to function, though. Somewhat disappointing is the fact that notes are not synched. Another nice addition is \'Voice Memos\' which is an audio recorder. Had the Touch an internal mic, this app would have been even better...\n \n Applications\n Next to the \'productivity\' or \'PDA\' suite (Mail, Calendar, Contacts) the touch comes with some other nice (but somewhat dull) apps (e.g. Maps, Stocks, YouTube) and two killer Apps: iTunes and App Store. While the former gives you instant access to all songs and movies that are currently available on iTunes (Warning: that, plus the incredible \'Shazam\' can lead to unintented gross music spending), the latter (App Store) gives you equal instant access to an incredible number of applications that you can instantly download and use. The quality of applications on the App Store is quite uneven, and tends to cluster around some rather puerile topics (as a veritable, uh, heap, of Fart applications proves). That being said, there are a number of jaw-droppingly good applications that are able to utilize the touch interface (and other capabilities such as accelerometer) in new and surprising ways. Just to name a few are the aforementioned \'Shazam\' that can identify a song being played and instantly link to iTunes (you have to see it in action to believe it), Flight Control, where you manage an airport by drawing the flight path for each plane, Bloomberg that provides stock information in an exhaustive way, and Wemlin that shows an up-to-date timetable for when the next tram arrives at my station. No matter what, there probably is an application that supports you with it.\n And then there are games. Apple had quickly recognized that the Touch represents an immensely attractive and powerful game platform. Performance, screen, connectivity and control capabilities make it the ideal casual gaming platform. Accordingly, games represent by far the largest category in the App store. While inevitably there are some truly awfully executed, or simply dull games, the majority of the available games are at least somewhat entertaining, while some rival and exceed those that can be had for thrice the price on dedicated gaming platforms.  \n \n In the past, my Touch quickly filled up with app after app that I simply couldn\'t live without any more, and an unforseen limitation of the Touch\'s design surfaced: app management. Applications are arranged as icons on a 4x4 grid per page, with multiple pages that you can flick left and right to navigate. Unfortunately, re-arranging apps, although possible (and quite ingeniously implemented) is still a chore. Apple has done the right thing, and integrated a much nicer app manager into the (PC/Mac) iTunes application.\n \n Speed Improvement\n The iPod Touch, although seen by some as the \'iPhone\'s smaller sibling\' was always either as nible as the phone, or even faster. The new, 3rd gen Touch is said to be \'up to 50% faster\' than the previous generation. To be honest, I\'m not sure that I see that speed improvent translate to much performance increase. That may be due to the fact that my Touch seldom maxes out on processor throughput or (for example when browsing) that WiFi bandwidth is the limiting factor. Some apps appear to be \'snappier\' during start-up (smaller apps) or execution (games, mostly), but all in all, the Touch pretty much seems to be as fast as the last generation. This leads me to believe that the real bottleneck is it\'s internal execution memory (i.e. not the 64 GB storage, but processor memory), and ony applications that are specifically written to take advantage of new technology (e.g. OpenGL ES). Or in other words: the overall speed has not been improved that much.\n \n SDK\n So you want to be a geek? Already are? You can write your own applications for the Touch if you like. I\'ve taken the plunge and downloaded the SDK. Note that you can download the SDK and develop for the Touch/iPhone without actually owning one. The development system comes with a iPhone simulator that you can use to test your applications without downloading them unto an actual device (it does have some limitations: for example, the accelerometers are not simulated, and you have no indication of the true execution speed). Well, you do need a Mac for this (although it can be a few years old). The SDK is impressive - overwhelming even if you are not used to Mac programming (and almost prohibitively complex if you are not used to frameworks like Cocoa and object-oriented programming). Still, crunching out your first (very basic) appliction is surprisingly easy, and if you roll that way, you\'ll get addicted quickly.\n \n Summary:\n It\'s the killer personal entertainment device. Buy it. You know you want it -- especially if you have read this far. If you have the 2nd gen iPod, you may need to ask yourself if the slight speed bump and the additional storage is worth the hefty price tag. To me it was, but your mileage may vary.\n \n pros\n + world class touch/gesture interface \n + best iPod audiovisual experience around (music, video, photos)\n + killer feature: app store and application availability\n + killer feature: internet integration (browsing and push technology)\n + great movie playback\n + really good casual gaming device\n + slightly improved speed (allegedly, only for some games)\n + great integration with mobile me (calender, mail sync) or Exchange\n + really good SDK if you are geeky enough to roll your own apps\n \n \n cons\n - no built-in mic (headphones do have them)\n - polished chrome backplate (I would have preferred a brushed finish)\n - no gps, camera, compass\n - no radio (nano has it?)\n - no sync of notes, no wireless sync of music/movies\n - spotty voice recognition in languages other than english\n - no control over downsampling of photos\n - no search function for music inside the iPod app\n - no visualizer \n \n'

Passport likes to put their logo in the corner of the screen and finds just about the worst quality they can possibly dig up. This DVD has jumps in the film and couldn't get too much more grainy looking.\n \n This is the second time I've been burned by Passport video. The first time being their DVD of Plan 9 From Outer Space which suffers the same fate. If I had noticed this one was released by Passport I wouldn't have bought it but I didn't even check.

aS"\nThere are at least two known breeds of Spotted Dick (or Spotted Dog, as it was once called).  The one that was a staple of my childhood (English working class) diet is a steamed suet pudding.  It is made from suet, flour, sugar, currants and raisins, and is usually served with treacle.\n \n The Heinz canned version is a very different animal, a member of the sponge pudding race, containing no suet.  It is nice enough, and is especially good with English-style custard.  It is tasty, filling and easy to prepare, and its name makes it great fun.\n \n But if you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin stories and want to eat like them, be warned that this is not the real thing.  The genuine Spotted Dick (or Dog), described in O'Brian's books, is the glorious suet pudding of my youth.\n [PeterReeve]\n \n"

aS'\nIn 2000, a Baltimore newspaper ran a story with the headline, "Local Graduate Named Rhodes Scholar." It was a story about the author, Wes Moore, a young black man who rose from the drug, crime and poverty-stricken streets of the city to attain this prestigious academic honor.\n \n Several months earlier, in the same paper, Mr. Moore had noticed a series of articles about two young black men who killed a Baltimore policeman while robbing a jewelry store. The name of one of the killers struck him: his name was Wes Moore. \n \n This coincidence prompts the author to seek out "the other Wes Moore." He contacts Wes in prison. "How did this happen?" he asks. The question jumpstarts the story of these two young men whose life paths diverged, one into triumph, the other into tragedy. \n \n The author comes to realize that this seemingly complicated story, a too-familiar story that is freighted with societal, economic and racial impact, comes down to a few simple moments in time. "These forks in the road can happen so fast for young boys," he says. "Within months or even weeks, their journeys can take a decisive and possibly irrevocable turn."\n \n I would more specifically pin the divergence on the boys\' mothers. The author is born into a two-parent home, both parents college educated, but his father dies when Wes is just three. His mother moves to the Bronx, so that her parents can help provide a stable home life. She works multiple jobs so that she can put her boys in private school. When the author starts to feel the pull of the streets, she packs him off to military school.\n \n The other Wes Moore grows up in a single-parent household of starkly different character. His father is absent and his mother frequently dumps him on friends and family so she can go out clubbing. Although she\'d been attending community college, she loses her Pell Grant and simply gives up. Disagreements in the home are handled with beatings. The older brother gets into the drug trade, and all three of them, mother and two sons, bring babies into the world without the stability of marriage. It\'s no surprise when the other Wes Moore\'s run-ins with the law begin. \n \n This is a compelling story told with passion and understanding. While the author is compassionate, he also makes clear that he is in no way excusing the other Wes Moore for his heinous deed. Even so, I imagine this is a tough book for the family of the slain policeman to read. If you want another great story of a young black man from Baltimore who succeeds thanks to his determined mother, read Byron Pitts\'s Step Out on Nothing: How Faith and Family Helped Me Conquer Life\'s Challenges .\n'

aS'\nLet\'s face it:  If you are conservative then you probably will agree with Rush but if you lean towards liberal then you probably can\'t stand him.\n \n In my case, I\'ve read Rush\'s first book "The Way Things Ought  to Be" and found it to be full of inaccuracies, unsubstantiated and  outrageous claims, and misinformation.  That\'s not to say Rush is a complete moron because he does put forth some good arguments, but overall,  I think Al Franken proves his case to convince me that Rush is a (big fat)  idiot.\n \n I like this book because it is hysterically funny and quite  entertaining.  Al\'s wit is dry and sometimes vicious.  I laughed to tears  when I read the chapter about Phil Gramm ("I own more guns than I  need, but not as many as I want.")\n \n He lampoons the right wing, and I  think he does it well.

aS"\nThe post-apocalypse sub-genre of science fiction has always been a place I like to go.  I'll give movies of this type some slack I wouldn't always give other kinds, so that even a relatively weak post-apoc flick like Doomsday (in which Malcolm McDowell appeared, as he does here) still has its interesting moments. But if it's a good one such as I Am Legend, I'm really into it bigtime.  So I've been eagerly anticipating The Book of Eli from the time the first trailers appeared, and now that I've seen it there were many things about it I liked.  Start with the mythic prophet main character.  His super-heroic weapons skills showed there was something unique about him early on.  Those scenes were generally pretty cool, and they were spread out pretty well over the length of the film.  (Any more fight scenes would have bored me.)  Eli's story plays out with a kind of grim determinism, although it also has hopeful elements as well.  I was glad I wasn't previously familiar with the story, as the major revelations about the Book in the final act were a complete surprise.   Mr. Washington was an excellent choice for the lead.  Other roles were well cast too, including (to my surprise) Jennifer Beals as the blind mistress of Gary Oldman's bad boss character.  Oldman himself struck just the right notes of ego, madness & desperation.   Anyway, as far as the post-apoc nature of the movie, it provides fascinating glimpses of which possessions would be really valuable in such a world (ex., chapstick yes; cigarette lighter, not so much), and other aspects of survival felt very authentic throughout the film.  All in all, it wasn't quite the adventure I was expecting (with occasional pacing issues), but I still found it to be an enjoyable viewing experience.\n"

aS'\nI did not think I needed yet another remote control because I thought the six-axis had everything it needed for movie playing on the PS3 and, yet, I bought one. There were 2 initial reasons:\n \n - my wife was missing a \'magic wand\' shaped remote for playing movies\n - Amazon had it at a great price in one of them lightning deals\n \n I ended up using it myself and, in fact, using it for more than just movie playing - see below.\n \n But, let\'s do a quick inventory of features:\n \n = It\'s blue-tooth enabled and, therefore, it\'s not taking any ports on your PS3. This is probably important for anyone who has a "2-USB ports console".\n = It\'s wand-shaped, allowing the non-gamers to control their movie-watching activities while holding a familiar-shaped device in their hand.\n = It maps ALL the six-axis buttons and performs everything a six-axis would do, except for the joystick features of R3 and L3 (but you do have the push-down or \'click\' abilities for them).\n = 2 AA battery powered (still with the original Sony batteries after 4 months of use)\n = Includes additional buttons that the movie-only users would expect on a remote such as:\n  + a number pad\n  + eject\n  + red, green, blue, yellow buttons\n  + play, stop, pause\n  + slow(step), scan(left/right), prev/next\n  + display, top menu, pop up menu, return\n  + subtitles, angle, audio\n \n \n What is interesting about this remote is that you can use it for much more than movie-playing. Given that it has all the six-axis buttons, guess what? You can use it, and I do use it to:\n \n - surf the web\n - play music\n - shop at the PSN store\n - play certain games such as Sudoku\n - turn the PS3 on/off when your six-axis controllers are in the charger and I am playing GT5 that is using a racing wheel\n \n And, yes, you CAN turn the PS3 on and off with this remote. Turning it on is easy - you simply press the PlayStation button and the PS3 turns itself on. To turn it off, you either go as far to the left on the X-bar and all the way up and press Enter (the turn-off PlayStation icon will be highlighted) or you simply hold the PlayStation button pressed for a few seconds and then select \'yes\' and press the X button a couple of times.\n \n Overall: I am happy with this peripheral. Yes, it\'s one more remote control but it\'s a pretty good one, for the reasons I stated above.\n \n _______________________________\n \n Notes - Aug 29, 2009, after 16 months of use\n \n I find that I\'m using the remote more and more, not only for playing movies but for navigating the XMB and at the PSN Store, also when playing music or slideshows. Due to its very convenient arrows wheel with an \'enter\' button in the middle, navigating the PS3 and doing just about anything other than playing games is a lot easier than using the PS3 game controller. Unlike the controller which normally requires two hands to hold, this is basically a one-hand operation where you hold the remote in one hand and operate the wheel with your thumb. And because it\'s Bluetooth, not IR (Infrared), you don\'t even need to point it at the PS3.\n \n And, one word on battery life. After about 15-16 months of operation, this is probably the third set of batteries so I\'d estimate battery life to be about 4-6 months. Not too bad.\n'

aS'\nThese cushion crew socks by Hanes are very well made and they keep your feet warm. I started to wear these when it\'s cold at night and I want to sleep with socks on my feet. These crew socks can be worn for athletic activities but they\'re probably more suited for everyday routine wear. \n \n These crew length socks have a reinforced heel and toe; this makes them last longer and they still feel very comfortable on my feet. The socks only come in white; and that is a disappointment. However, these are relatively affordable yet good quality socks especially if you need white socks! \n \n I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. These socks contain spandex, so high temperature drying would probably result in the socks becoming too loose on your feet. Eventually the fabric could loosen so much that the socks will "bunch up" almost as low as your ankles when you wear them--and that\'s very uncomfortable. Dry these socks at a lower temperature. Then they will remain just as comfortable as ever. \n \n Overall, you can\'t go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get more than your money\'s worth. Not bad at all!\n \n'

aS"\nI bought this for hubby dear to keep warm when he plays his video games or while watching a movie. The throw is not as soft as I expected but it definitely makes up for that in terms of warmth. We really wish it were longer so we could snuggle in it together but it definitely is worth the price I paid for it ($12). My toddler started hogging the throw once she discovered how snuggly it felt and I bought her one for her very own, with which she is extremely pleased! It's the perfect size when used as a toddler blanket and she's kept very warm during cold Wisconsin winter nights.\n"

aS"\nI recently obtained Dr. Pitcairn's book and found it to be a wonderful, easy to implement and understand book on natural care for dogs and cats. Dr. Pitcairn provides concise information on dogs and cats from what to feed, to training, and even about how to choose a dog breed for your lifestyle. This book also has lots of natural prevention remedies included and how to PREVENT pesky problems like fleas and ticks from invading your home and your pets. \n \n One of the things I educate pet owners on is prevention being the key and that is done through a strong immune system by feeding and supplementing properly. I always tell them that once your pet is diseased you'll need to see a veterinarian and then undo the illness and disease if you can, then build your pet back up. Dr. Pitcairn shares a lot about prevention and that thrilled me! That is the answer and key to keeping our pets healthy. \n \n He shares about natural feeding which is another big issue I like to tackle with pet owners. He even includes grooming. This is a must have book for any dog or cat owner who wants to approach their pet care naturally and preventatively. Excellent book! \n \n Kim Bloomer\n [...]\n"

aS"\nPREFACE:\n \n I bought this card for extra disk space on my Asus EeePC netbook. I needed as much space as possible to supplement the very small SSD hard drive. I needed something with large capacity and relatively fast file transfer time.\n \n PROS:\n \n It shares the largest SD capacity on the market today with few others (Panasonic, Sandisk, and PNY) and is a quality name that I have had a good history with in the past. Its file transfer time is similar to the SSD drive in my machine so it basically acts as a second SSD for me at less than a quarter of the price!\n \n CONS: \n \n Its not the cheapest 32gb SD card(PNY) nor the fastest(Panasonic) but its good quality with a decent transfer rate.\n \n CONCLUSION:\n \n I'm very happy with its performance and capacity. I would like to see the price come down a bit, but that's the price of getting electronics of this caliber.\n \n That's my input, take it or leave it :)\n"

aS'\nIn 2007, operatives working out of the Vice-president of the United States\' office were informed that there were ninety-two missing videotapes. Those tapes documented the extreme torture of ghost detainees, individuals captured and whisked away to secret prisons, people who simply disappeared. Waterboarding, while documented on the tapes, was not the worst thing that happened to the ghost detainees. Ulrich, the lead operative, crafts a plausible story to spin to the media, which allows everyone else to sigh in relief. \n \n Two years later, someone surfaces, contacts one of the operatives, and tells him that he is in possession of the ninety-two videotapes. He will release them to the world\'s media in five days if he is not paid $100 million in small, uncut diamonds.\n \n In a Manila jail, Ben Treven is awaiting his fate for the killing of an Australian sailor. Ben was a member of an elite squad of men who "fixed" problems. He was hand picked for the squad because of his skills in stealth, observation and tactics, and use of deadly force. Waiting out his days, he is visited by his old commander, Colonel "Hort" Horton, who has a proposition; find and detain the person that is blackmailing the United States government. There are not many clues, however Hort believes that a dead man has the tapes, a person who died in an explosion in Pakistan in 2007.\n \n Treven wants out of the jail, but he also wants a measure of revenge from Hort, who tried to kill him, his brother, and a female lawyer when an advanced encryption software program was being readied for market. Treven accepts the offer.\n \n It isn\'t long until Ben discovers that he isn\'t the only person looking for the tapes or the blackmailer; the FBI and CIA are on the case as well. The CIA is willing to kill in order to recover the tapes. Ben\'s unique skills as a military assassin will be tested if he is to be the first to the finish line. \n \n Barry Eisler has published another excellent novel that focuses on a character, Ben Treven, whom he introduced in his 2009 novel, Fault Line. Inside Out propels Ben to the forefront; you learn more about him, his training, his background, and the skills that make him so effective and deadly. Should you be unfamiliar with Fault Line, do not worry, Eisler provides a few references, but they are not necessary to the story line of Inside Out. What you will become familiar with in this novel are some of the darkest secrets of government. While Eisler has crafted an excellent thriller, it isn\'t until you reach the Sources and Bibliography that you realize that he has scripted a fictional account of real events.\n \n That is not all, however. Eisler works some other ideas into the novel, ones that will make you reconsider what you think you hear, what you think you know. For a work of fiction, it is startling in its depth of research, as presented by the bibliography. Further, Eisler worked another of his characters, John Rain, into Inside Out, which bodes well for regular readers of his novels. The future is bright for Eisler\'s fans and those that like thrilling action, well defined characterization, believable dialog, and thought provoking story lines. \n \n Disclosure: \n Obtained from: Amazon Vine Review Program\n Payment: Free\n'

aS'\nI have been a great fan of Laurell Hamilton.  I greatly admire her writing ability and imagination.  And her daring as well, she is willing to confront unusual sexual issues in a genre where sexuality is more often a matter of hints and gestures.   Struck by the intensity of the sexual focus in her recent work I thought it would be entertaining to go back and reread some of Hamilton\'s earlier books. "Guilty Pleasures" is the first of the Anita Blake series.  What makes the series unique is the strong, tough-minded character of the heroine and narrator.  Before "Guilty Pleasures" vampire stories rarely had female leads, let alone one with the hard-nosed style of Anita Blake.  She is a professional animator (one who raises the dead) and a licensed vampire killer in an alternate earth where vampires have come out of the closet (coffin?) and are active participants in American life. Hamilton\'s vampires are of the Anne Rice genre.  They are beautiful, deadly and follow their own code of ethics.  Many humans have become enthralled with them, but many are deeply suspicious.  To Anita they are monsters who, when they go out of control, must be killed.  But U.S. law protects vampires that behave themselves.  Even so, when someone starts killing the vampires of St. Louis, authorities make little progress.  Angered, two of the strongest vampires in the city, Jean-Claude and Nikolaos, convince Anita to hunt down the killer. Jean-Claude is one of the modern romantic vampires, easy to look at with fine manners and style.  Nikolaos, on the other hand, is a thousand year old sadistic horror in the body of a thirteen year old girl.  Her powers are unimaginable and dark hungers hide under her innocent looks.  The vampiress takes an immediate dislike to Anita\'s feisty style and our heroine spends as much time dodging Nikolaos\' efforts to injure and enslave her as she does seeking the killer.  Jean-Claude comes under attack as well as he tries to help Anita. Hamilton\'s way with characters is one of her great strengths.  We meet several of Anita\'s regular companions for the first time.  Edward the hyper-violent bounty hunter, and Veronica, a private investigator and friend are outstanding, as are many of the bit players.  Her vampires and their human servants are vivid personalities.  This gives the novel a realistic feel that comes as a surprise in the vampire genre.  The plot is fast paced, often moving from cliff-hanger to horrific confrontation with all the agility of the ball in a pinball game.  There is a steady sexual undercurrent that veers towards sadistic and fetish oriented pleasures.  It is a natural outgrowth of the vampire personality and is as chilling as it is erotic.  In "Guilty Pleasures" it is an effective plot device that keeps the heat turned up.  If you are a vampire story fan you will find Laurell Hamilton\'s efforts deeply satisfying.\n'

aS'\nIt has been a while since I\'ve encountered a horror novel of such magnitude and scope, but Justin Cronin\'s hefty tome "The Passage" seems poised to announce itself as the latest true "horror epic."  It\'s about time too!  Ambitious and thought-provoking, but filled with propulsive action and bloodshed, "The Passage" is the thinking person\'s genre thrill ride.  This massive book starts in the near future with a pretty unique combination of vampiric lore meshed with science gone awry.  But Cronin, while nailing these explosive first chapters, has much more up his sleeve.  The expansive (and sometimes it seems the story will never end) plot resets several times until we have followed the confrontations to their inevitable conclusion many generations later.       \n  \n The comparisons to Stephen King\'s "The Stand" seem apt and, I believe, will be widespread.  And in case anyone has a passing interest on where I fall on "The Stand," I think it\'s the best book of its type that I\'ve ever read.   Although the books are quite different in plotting and structure, thematically they share much.  From the veritable destruction of the world as we know it, to the efforts to rebuild some semblance of a new world order, to the ultimate confrontation between good an evil replete with the requisite supernatural underpinnings--both books challenge ordinary citizens to rise to extraordinary levels to champion the human cause.  In the right hands, these apocalyptic epics can be unforgettable--and I\'ll just say that Cronin\'s hands are quite capable.  \n  \n Don\'t misunderstand the King reference, however, "The Passage" stands as its own unique portrait of a ravaged future.  It\'s just that there are so few horror novels that set out to accomplish so much in storytelling.  Cronin\'s novel is gutsy, challenging and filled with high level drama of the first order.  It\'s not breezy or light entertainment, however.  It\'s a serious reading commitment for those looking for their gore mixed with a lot of substance.  A real change-of-pace and a welcome new addition to the ranks of horror lore, "The Passage" has earned the title of "epic."       \n \n'

aS'\nI have read 100\'s of very poor books on the Laws of Attraction in the last few years. I started reading books about goal setting, mind control and success principles in 1985. I have used what I learnt from my extensive reading, coupled with academic qualifications, business and psychology experience, to create a consulting company, teaching seminars to corporations in strategic thinking, marketing, goal setting and business development. I also use the principles to help individuals, by guiding them as a Life Coach, teaching people cognitive methods to help goal set and enhance their lives beyond what they could do on their own. As such, I read as many books as I can on a variety of subjects to enhance my knowledge. I can honestly say, that with all that experience, this DVD, is good as an introduction to the concept, BUT it is not as good as a book like Law of Attraction in Action, which I feel covers all bases needed for the LOA to work.\n \n Many people in my experience cannot get the LOA to work, as they have too much OLD subconscious programming blocking the process. You can use the Sedona Method to unblock this old rubbish in the brain, but this DVD, does not cover this area. Also the second key to getting the LOA working, is to take "Inspired Action". This DVD seems to make the case for "thinking will do it all". ACTION, inspired by the dreams, working with a positive mental attitude, is what is needed. This DVD skips this vital part. The aforementioned book covers this area in great detail. I would also highly recommend Your Road Map to Success by John C Maxwell, as a great book to create a life purpose, from which you can use the LOA. There are other great books on the market that can help, but I recommend starting with these.\n \n This DVD is a nice intro into LOA, but you need to do more reading in the areas I have highlighted, if you wish to get the LOA working in your life. Good DVD as far as it goes.\n'

aS'\nI bought Canada Green Grass through Amazon last fall (2006). Prior to overseeding with it in my front yard, I core aerated and dethatched and then put the seed down heavily.  I covered it with straw and it came up great with a few bare patches left before winter came.\n \n This spring, I am amazed! It is growing into an incredibly thick and beautiful turf! It looks wonderful! I have done this process before with other seed mixtures, but never with this kind of result.  The only question mark is how it will do once we have our very hot and very dry spell here in Missouri this summer. But the thickness and density of the turf is what has amazed me the most.\n'

aS"\nThe book tells the story from the alternating points of view of two characters. Grace has been watching the wolves outside her Mercy Falls, Minnesota home every winter. She is drawn to one in particular that has stunning yellow eyes, and she's certain that it is the same wolf who saved her from a pack of wolves who attacked her when she was a young girl.\n \n Sam leads two lives. In the spring and summer, he's human, but when the cooler temperatures of autumn descend upon him, it's not long before he turns into a wolf for the winter. The problem with being a werewolf is that the longer you're a wolf, the less time you spend in your human form until one spring, you don't change back and are forever a part of the wolf world.\n \n When Grace meets Sam, one look at his yellow eyes makes her certain that he's her wolf. They are drawn to each other and it doesn't take them long to realize that they've been in love for years as impossible as it may seem. As the temperatures get cooler, Sam and Grace struggle to keep him human, but the bitter cold and other obstacles threaten to take him away from her forever.\n \n What I love about Maggie Stiefvater's writing, especially in Shiver, is that it's completely seamless: the transitions between the two main characters' points of view and the way that she brings werewolves into what seems like a perfectly normal world. I'm one of those people who rarely reads chapter titles or headings because I find them distracting, and not once did I have to glance up at the beginning of a chapter to see who was speaking. Sam and Grace have their own distinct voices and characteristics, but the switch from character to character is not jarring the way I've seen it in a lot of other books. And the coolest thing? Grace and Sam each have their own strengths and complement each other well. I love to see strong female characters in books for teens, and Grace is definitely smart and strong and can take care of herself.\n \n But what I love the most about Ms. Stiefvater's writing is her ability to depict chemistry between two characters--first with Dee and Luke in Lament and now with Sam and Grace. She's masterful at showing and not telling: glances, touches, dialogue, and thoughts all create a completely believable love between a girl and a werewolf.\n \n Shiver is a perfectly executed book, and I continue to be impressed with Maggie Stiefvater's writing. \n \n"

One star is like trying to bury the many insights  which this book magnificently exposes.  Bravo Barbara!\n"

aS"\nWhile I was looking for sub-woofer I was comparing PSW10 and PSW404. PSW404 sounds better but for the price $110 vs. $250 at J&R I opted for PSW10. The sale representative dropped the price for me even though they still selling PSW10 for $200 here. Those of you who worry about no LFE input, that shouldn't be a problem. All you have to do is connect the sub-woofer output of the receiver to either the right or left input on the sub-woofer. And then set the variable low pass filter on the sub-woofer to the highest setting. This will set the internal low pass filter above the low pass filter frequency given by your receiver and create an LFE input. Or you may use a RCA cable to provide a connection to both inputs on the sub-woofer from the LR pre-out from the receiver. Then adjust the cross over frequency from the woofer as desired. It sounds a little louder and better for me. I bought Monster sub-woofer cable and it sounds no better than RCA cable. Try not to waste your money on this. It has 7.4 out of 10 in CNet rating and it is #6 in editor's top list for sub-woofers. I matched PSW10 with R300, RTi4, R150, CSi3 and Denon 1906 receiver. Mainly used for HDTV over the air, DVD movies and some FM. It sounds a lot better than the sub-woofer from RM6750. It carries 5 years warranty but make sure you buy from Authorize dealer. For the price I paid I am more than happy with it. I hope this helps to your decision.\n"

I had the EXACT same problem as many others seem to be having: the battery simply will not charge.  The recharging process is easy, though--you simply plug the device into the USB port on your computer.  The only problem was that, no matter how long I kept the device plugged in, I continued to get a "battery low" warning.

aS'\nI was looking for another edition of TESS and couldn\'t believe my eyes when I saw the "average customer rating" was only three stars.  So I\'m taking a moment to correct the balance. TESS OF THE D\'URBERVILLES must be as close to a perfect novel as anyone has written in English.  It is a genuine tragedy with a girl/woman as tragic hero.  It is about life on earth in a way that transcends mere sociology.  It has the grandeur of Milton but concerns itself with the lives of mortal beings on earth, as much with sex as with dirt, blood, milk, dung, animal and vegetative energies.  It concerns itself with only essential things the way the Bible does.  It is almost a dark rendering of the Beatitudes. The story is built with such care and such genius that every incident, every paragraph, reverberates throughout the whole structure.  Surely Hardy had an angel on his shoulder when he conceived and composed this work.  Yet it was considered so immoral in its time that he had to bowdlerize his own creation in order to get it published, at first.  Victorian readers were not prepared for the truth of the lives of ordinary women, or for a great many truths about themselves that Hardy presents.   The use of British history as a hall of mirrors and the jawdropping detail of the landscape of "Wessex" make it the Great English Novel in the way we sometimes refer to MOBY DICK as the Great American Novel, though the works don\'t otherwise bear comparison.  Melville\'s great white whale is a far punier creation. Hardy\'s style is like no one else\'s.  It is not snappy, as Dickens can be.  It is not fluid and elegant, like George Eliot\'s.  It can feel labored and awkward and more archaic than either.  It has no journalistic flavor, but is painfully pure and deliberate and dense, echoing Homer or the language of the Old Testament rather than anything we think of as "modern."  Don\'t start with TESS but with FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, another very beautiful book, where Hardy is at his loosest and wittiest.  Once you have the key to his style, then pick up a good edition of TESS with notes, e.g. Penguin, so you get the full richness of all the literary allusions.  Hardy\'s lowly shepherds and farmhands move and breathe in a very ancient literary atmosphere.  The effect is not pretentious but timeless.   There is wisdom, poetry and majesty here.  Tess stumbling through the dark and taking her last rest at Stonehenge will send chills up your spine like no other reading experience.  I wonder if anyone can know why there are novels, why we care about them, or what they are capable of, without reading this one.\n'

aS"\nThis is a great MP3/WMA player with one glaring deficiency: It insists on playing the songs in alphanumerical order by track title. The manual states this, customer support verified it and I couldn't find a reasonable work-around, so it went back. Sure you can manually move from one song to another as they play, but if you want to load an entire CD and listen to the songs in the order in which you're accustomed, it won't do it without interaction. In my opinion, this is a colossal design flaw. The original MuVo 64 and 128 will play the tracks in the order which you load them but not this one. If that won't bother you, the MuVo NX is the one to get.\n"

When they are betrayed by an enemy named Max, they become fugitives and are believed to be dead. They are forced to team up with a mysterious woman named Aisha who may be able to help them find Max. I understand this movie is based on a comic book by Vertigo, but I never read any, so I couldn't compare it. My favorite character was Chris Evans as Jensen, because he had all the hilarious lines. Another thing, was that this film reminds me a lot of 'The A-Team' If you love action, I highly recommend THE LOSERS!!! \n \n \n"

aS'\nThe original Mass Effect had a few flaws, but I consider it to be a solid game.  When Bioware developed this sequel, it seems like they tried to "fix" a little too much.\n \n Mass Effect 2 game feels more like a shooter than its predecessor and the combat is less forgiving even on the "casual" setting, which is disappointing for anyone who liked the more relaxed pace of the first game.  However, it retains several RPG elements to maintain the series\' feeling of depth, which might annoy gamers who want to get straight to the action.  It\'s a classic case of trying to please everyone and sacrificing the overall quality in the process.\n \n That being said, there\'s still plenty to like in this game.  Heavy weapons are a welcome addition, the Mako vehicle is a thankful omission, and the game is just as polished overall as the original was.  If you\'re a shooter fan who\'s a little burned out on Halo 3: ODST and Modern Warfare 2, or are planning on picking up Bioshock 2, you may want to skip this title.  Fans of the first game will be a little disappointed, but they should enjoy the return of Commander Shepherd.\n'

aS"\nThe Swivel Sweeper G2 works extremely well on hard floors. It's light weight and swivel to get around tight crevices. It also does a fairly decent cleaning job right up against the wall on hard floors and even carpets. Although for carpet cleaning in the central area of the room, you're better off using a conventional vacuum cleaner for that. The reason for this, that this sweeper is not a vacuum but a power brush system that would only get the surface dust off the carpet leaving the ground in dust. \n \n We bought this sweeper to use on hard floors prior to washing them. For that function it does extremely well, keeping the mop relatively lint free. For use on carpeting, you have to be careful that you don't cause the sweeper to flip and spilling the contents back onto the carpet. Since this kind of sweeper with no suction doesn't clean ground in dirt well on carpeting, I would not recommend it for this purpose.\n \n Previously, we bought the original Swivel Sweeper and now the Swivel Sweeper G2. When comparing the two, they both clean equally well. The Swivel Sweeper G2 is a little bit more convenient to use because of the refinement such as easier emptying as well as the articulating handle when you need to go underneath furniture.\n"

aS"\nJust got my receiver today, plugged everything and turned it on. At first, I was bit confused about setting it up and the remote controll, but after reading a bit from the manual I managed to set things up. After this I made a short sound check to see that everything worked and it did. Then I downloaded the update from Yamahas site and tried updating the receiver with PS3 Slim. Well for my suprice, receiver was already up to date. So now I wanted to test HD sounds and put Rambo IV in, and just wow, sound is great! Even I dont have the best speakers in the world, it still sounded a lot better than anything what I played before with my non-HD Sony receiver. After I had watched the movie I put radio on and just left it there. It has now been on for around 8 hours on row and every now and then when good song comes I turn volume up, but still its really hard to sence any heat over the receiver.\n Ok, it has only been in use for a day but so far I have really nothing to complain. Everything is connected with HDMI so I didn't need the analog upconversing. Even 7.1 system seems to work ok, but I don't have really anything to test it with, all blue-ray's only have 5.1 I was thinking of getting some 7.1 test trak later but so far so good. For me the thing that last 2 speakers need to be active ones (to get 6.1 or 7.1) wasn't an issue since I took those from my bedroom tv. Maybe going to put those back to bedroom atleast for a while when I can get something that has 7.1 sounds.\n"

aS'\nCoulter writes at what she does best, finding witty or witty sounding excuses to support Republicans over Democrats in any circumstance.  Frankly, about the only thing she and Democrats probably agree on is that Bush Jr. did not do a good job with the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and 9/11.  But of course, Coulter has some kind of excuse to blame Bush\'s responsibility on "any old Democrat" even though Democrats may have nothing to do with Bush Jr.\'s personal responsibilities or his decision for the country.  \n \n I think she makes some good points, and I think some things are just put out there and that she doesn\'t listen. She just wants only her opinion to be right to an extreme.  She\'s good at analyzing situations, but she would not be good for a government position requiring much trust to keep stability, that is for sure.  On the other hand, you probably want her to be your Republican lobbyist.  A "friend" a "Coulter Jr." told me about how great this book is.  He acts just like Coulter, but just doesn\'t publish books and goes out and speaks like she does.  Otherwise, he would probably be doing at least okay- (Coulter created and kept her niche first.)  I am not particularly Democrat or Republican, but I try to give everything a chance.  This book, while giving some fresh perspectives I would not have thought of, is quite hit or miss, too opinionated, and not always reasoning things out enough.\n'

aS"\nI have read about 5 books by Nora Roberts.  My favorite was Honest Illusions.  I tend to read historical romance.  A friend gave me my first Nora Roberts' book Born in Fire.  That series of three books held my  interest to try another book of Ms. Roberts.  Honest Illusions I could  keep; the others all went back.  Tucker and Caro were a good match, but my  favorite character was Cy.  I had a strong feeling who the killer was  during the pathology section in the book.  (Don't want to spoiler it for  others.)  The actual killer isn't revealed until about three pages before  the book ends; and I felt some people should have moved out-of-the-area (if  you catch my drift).  Hard for people to forget and forgive in a story  about serial killers.  Sorry all you Nora Roberts' fans.  I had better  stick to historicals.\n"

aS"\nHaving never owned - or even so much as used - a webcam prior to this, I don't have much point of reference.  That said, the installation of this product couldn't have been any easier.  On my older desktop system, the installation only took a few minutes.  The laptop I have is much newer, and the software installed even faster.  Absolutely trouble-free, and within minutes I had a picture on screen and was able to take photos and make videos.\n \n The adjustable clip on the back of the camera is very effective - it doubles as a stand, which came in handy on my bulky old non-flat screen monitor.  On my laptop screen it was just as handy, resting firmly in place at the top of the screen.\n \n I was truly impressed by the video quality.  Again, I've never owned a webcam previously, but I've viewed many webcam videos posted on websites - and I was aware that the image quality ran the gamut.  The lens on this webcam produces a very sharp, detailed image.  Even in relatively low-lighting, the picture wasn't bad at all.  On my several years old desktop, the image didn't keep up with the movements very well - moving my head from side to side, for instance, resulted in quite a blur.  But on my newer laptop, that blur was reduced extremely - the movements registered in more or less real-time.  The auto-focus feature seems to do it's job pretty well, and makes operation very simple.  \n \n The audio quality was definitely less impressive than the picture - but it was right in line with what I expected for a little tiny built-in microphone.  Loud noises clip and/or distort - I tried playing my saxophone and the result wasn't listenable (though some would say that's due to my playing ability).  Yelling, or even extremely loud talking, clips.  But all things considered, when remaining at a distance of a couple feet and talking at a normal, even volume - the audio quality was very acceptable.\n \n I got a kick out of the various visual features.  There are a bunch of filters - my favorite is the '50s style, creating a vintage black-and-white scratched up film look.  Neonize was a trip - darkening everything on screen except for neon-colored borders to everything.  The 'ghost' filter gives a blurred tracer effect to all movement.  I don't know how much need I'll have for these, but they're fun to mess around with.  There are also a bunch of options to change the look of your face on-screen - including 'robot face' which makes you look like a cyborg or something.  I don't honestly know what the 'avatar' feature was supposed to do - I aligned my face within the red box like it said to, but nothing really happened ever once I initiated the feature...\n \n Bottom line - speaking for total, complete, 100% webcam novices like myself:  this is a quality webcam that I could not imagine being easier to use.  The video quality is top-notch.  My biggest criticism - and this is actually kind of minor - is the utter lack of a storage case or pouch for the webcam.  I don't plan to leave mine out all the time and I'd like to keep the lens (rightfully rated highly) in good shape.  For the time being, I'm actually putting it back in the box but even a cheap felt pouch would've been nice.\n"

aS'\nFor those who don\'t know, the Panasonic G1 is the first (of hopefully many) camera that adheres to the new micro 4/3 format.  What is so exciting about it?  All SLR cameras use mirrors, prisms, and optical viewfinders so that the photographer can see what his/her subject "through the lens."  SLRs have remained the defacto standard for most serious photographers because most find the whole viewfinder concept so appealing.  The micro 4/3 does away with the mirrors and prisms, and replaces the optical viewfinder of SLRs with an electronic viewfinder.  This allows the cameras that adhere to the standard to be much smaller (and wideangle lenses designed for this mount to be smaller as well).  Onto the real review...\n \n The EVF on the G1 is the first that I\'ve seen that is remotely usable.  While not as good as the OVF in my 5D, it is considerably better than the OVF in my older 350D.  The first look through the EVF will impress anyone who hasn\'t used a Full-Frame camera before.  While there is a noticeable lag (particularly when moving the camera around...a delay of a 10th of a second maybe), the fact that you can see a live histogram in the VF makes the lag completely worthwhile.  Even better, the VF can increase the gain of the screen in darker conditions so you can actually see what you are shooting (it does get grainy, but it is better than seeing nothing at all).  Finally, when you engage Manual Focus, the view in the EVF zooms in on your subject automatically which allows for perfect manual focus adjustments every time!!  Without a doubt, this is the best interchangeable lens camera on the market if you are interested in manually focusing.\n \n The articulating LCD is another design choice that is spot-on!!  Why haven\'t other manufacturers caught on that "live view" is completely useless without an articulating LCD?  Switching from the LCD to the EVF is as simple as putting your eye next to the viewfinder.  There is a sensor there that detects when it is being used.  The LCD doesn\'t have the super resolution of the new 5DMkII or the D700, but it has twice the resolution of my older 5D.\n \n So is the camera pocketable?  Not a chance.  However, it isn\'t much bigger than the larger (with its kit lens) than modern superzoom Point&Shoot cameras.  I bought it because I found that I was leaving my 5D (with 24-70 f/2.8) at home more often than not because i didn\'t want to carry so much weight.  The G1, in comparison, is a joy to hold and carry.  For me, the size is just right.  Any smaller and the controls would be unusably small.  Any larger and the camera would begin to resemble smaller DSLRs.  Side Note:  The kit lens has to be seen to be believed...it is SO small.  Even the 45-200 lens (90-400) isn\'t much bigger than kit lenses for APS-C or FF cameras (let alone comparing it to the monstrous 100-400 lens that canon makes).\n \n Noise is reasonable.  I wouldn\'t go past ISO1250 for prints with the G1.  ISO1600 and 3200 are more than useable for web viewing (which is how a majority of my pics are displayed).  I never really understood how printable ISO6400 prints are suddenly required for every camera...how many people actually print a large number of images anyways?  Downsized to Facebook or Picasaweb sizes, I would imagine that a ISO6400 G1 image would be more than adequate.\n \n What I don\'t like is the lack of any large aperture lenses for the format.  You can buy adapters to use standard 4/3 lenses but the older 4/3 lenses are likely larger than their future micro43 counterparts (and AF doesn\'t work with many of them).  Adapters also exist for Leica M mount (I\'m trying to convince my fiance that leica lenses are a better investment than the stock market right now...but I don\'t think that she is buying it).  The depth of field for micro43 is already larger due to the smaller sensor so it will be hard to get subject isolation in photographs until large aperture prime lenses become available.\n \n I\'m really excited about the future of this format.  Panasonic has promised a G1HD someone in the first half of this year (a G1 with video capabilities).  In addition, 3 new lenses have been announced:  a 7/14 f/4, a 14-140, and best of all a 20 mm f/1.7 pancake!  Olympus also showed off a concept of a micro43 camera that looked no bigger than a small point&shoot.  The future is exciting!\n'

aS"\nI rarely will type/review products but I've been a little frustrated reading the reviews of this product on Amazon and by users at other sites.  Many users seem to think that this camera was designed to compete with expensive, professional cameras that cost thousands of dollars and produce full HD quality video.  That's not what this is. Also, while my camera hasn't had the 'noise' issue from the Mic, i have seen a camera that had the issue and its BARELY noticeable.  Its almost like a very quiet background noise from a Florescent light or something.\n \n Kodak has designed, marketed, and built a camera to compete with FLiP and has clearly produced a FAR better product.\n \n I'll keep it short and sweet and first explain who I am and what I am using this camera for.  I use it for: \n -Home Videos/Fun stuff with old buddies and friends\n -For work when I need some quick video that's easy to upload online, or put in iMovie and edit\n -For work when I need more complex videos that may require editing, or somewhat lengthy video but I want the ease of use/portability.\n \n I have seen some of the problems stated with the internal Mic and I have had none of them (I do have the upgraded Firmware that is now standard 1.03, and Kodak says this completely eliminates the issue...again have never had the issue on my camera).  A relative of mine was lucky enough to purchase this product when Kodak did an 'early' release a few months ago and occasionally his videos will have a bit of a higher pitched background noise, but it doesn't interfere with the sound from the video -- its just a light background noise that, honestly, i've heard on dozens of cameras.  Don't forget, without an external Mic the camera only records mono so -- the sounds quality isn't going to be great anyway!\n \n The video is great, image stability isn't as advanced as those available on more expensive cameras but it is better than anything i've seen in a FLiP or other Kodak model.  It does work and you can see a difference, even if its not huge.   Its SO easy to flip between video modes.  The 1080p is awesome, but sometimes its nice to move back down to 720 and the 60fps to capture 'action' footage.  \n \n One negative -- which most people may see as a positive -- i do wish there were more settings, or at least the ability to play around with more features/edit modes.  Its GREAT easy to use, its a point and shoot video camera -- but with the great lens and abilities, it seems like Kodak could have -- pretty easily -- had this camera competing with much higher end cameras. If all the hardware was put to great use this could compete with $500+ cameras.  But I understand wanting to keep it simple.\n \n I like having the SD card.  Some people would prefer the internal memory, and yes by the time you buy a decent sized SD card the camera is more expensive than the FLiP, but, the FLiP has a very limited memory.  This camera is limited only by the size of the card...Definitely a positive!\n \n Finally, I know people that are both in the TV business and do a lot of Video blogging and they are drooling over this camera because of the external mic capabilities. One reason lots of 'pros' didn't like FLiP was because of the audio issues.  Kodak has solved those, not to mention providing better quality video.\n \n Again this isn't something to shoot with if your a young film-maker or a die-hard amateur cinematographer.  But if you need something cheap to get some great quality video, or need something super easy to use that is really portable....Take the plunge. And if your considering FLiP -- don't bother...\n"

aS'\n In college I went through a phase where I read all the Sherlock Holmes stories. Once I got started reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s stories, I didn\'t want to stop. It was sad when I read the last story. \n \n Now years later it was fun to read them again. I enjoy the Sherlock Holmes short stories more than one of the novels. For me one of the most enjoyable parts of a Sherlock Holmes story is reading about what happened, and then reading how Sherlock Holmes solved the problem. A collection of short stories provides this experience many times. \n \n This collection has many classics. It has the famous line "It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." (The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet.) \n \n It is also interesting to see what life was like in England 100 years ago. They had the underground, but use carriages, there was lots of travel by train, and life in general was a bit rougher than today. \n \n If you haven\'t read any Sherlock Holmes stories, this is a good place to start. \n \n'

aS'\nThe King James Version of the Bible (a.k.a. the Authorized Version) is an English translation of the Bible published in 1611.  Commissioned by King James I of England, 54 scholars were approved by the king of whom 47 labored in six groups at three locations for seven years making use of both texts in the original languages and previous English translations.  The result was a translation that had a marked influence on English style and literature because of its flowing language and prose rhythm, and was generally accepted as the standard English Bible for more than three centuries.\n \n When I was teaching A.P. English I strongly recommended to my students that the two supplemental texts they should have for class should be a copy of the King James Version of the Bible with a good concordance, and Edith Hamilton\'s "Mythology."  Of course in the age of searchable on-line texts such suggestions are of less value, but the religious and mythical allusions that appear in the works of Dante, Shakespeare, Milton and many other writers (not to mention politicians such as Lincoln), cannot readily understood unless you recognize them.  Just in the first 11 chapters of Genesis we have two creation stories, the fall, the story of Cain and Abel, the flood, and the tower of Babel.  All of these are major touchstone is contemporary literature.  What is the biggest money making movie of all-time but a retelling of the story of the tower of Babel turned into the arrogance of the construction of a ship that supposedly not even God could sink?  As for our willingness to accept different versions of the same tale, I can argue that comes primarily from our reading of the four Gospels since billions more have done that then read the three extant Greek tragedies on the slaying of Clytemnestra by Orestes (which everyone should also still be reading as literature).\n \n However, over the years I increasingly faced objections from students who felt that using the Bible as a reference book, or studying it as literature, was a waste of time since the Bible was not "true" (as near as I can tell the distinction between "true" and "True" is not germane to their position).  Of course, they failed to appreciate the irony that they were making this argument in a course devoted to studying the various forms of fiction.  But the book of Job is a didactic poem set in a prose framing device, which to me indicates it is a lesson rather than a true story and suggests it can be considered an extant fictional narrative (if not outright drama) contemporary to the time of the great tragic poets in Athens.  One that gets in the door as "legitimate" literature, the rest of the books of the Bible deserve the same consideration.\n \n To the extent that the Bible contains a coherent system of symbols, presents a tightly unified set of controlling themes, and explores the fundamental questions of human existence it functions as literature, without sacrificing its theological import.  Ancient history has long been treated as literature of a kind, songs have always been considered poetic, and epistolary writing counts too.  It should be kept in mind that while the Bible can be considered as literature as well as sacred writing there is also value in using the critical techniques of literature to read the Bible as scripture as well.  The Bible is also important to the study of comparative religion, history, archeology, cultural anthropology, and other studies of the human condition. \n \n Most importantly, when it comes down to reading the Bible as literature there can really be no other choice than the King James Version.  The eminence of this translation has been codified by such diverse entries as "Bartlett\'s Familiar Quotations," which use the KJV as the source for all Bible quotations, and the character Linus in "A Charlie Brown Christmas," use recites the story of the nativity from the KJV version of the 2nd chapter of Luke.  At least to those of us who are Baby Boomers, this is the way the Bible should sound and the black imitation leather cover is appropriately old school as well.\n'

aS'\n"Lord of the Flies" is singularly the most important novel for required reading, whether assigned in school or self-imposed. It regularly appears as number one on my own list of best books.\n \n Let\'s play "What if." What if a plane carrying a full load of school boys crashes on a deserted island with no adult survivors? What would happen to those boys? What would you expect to happen?\n \n William Golding works with this premise: an idyllic setting, innocent schoolboys. One boy, an older boy just short of teenage years, a boy with fair hair, assumes leadership to stir the others into some semblance of organization and survival mode, much like adults would do if adults were present. He also saw a need to defuse the web of fear of the younger ones. Where are we? How long will we need to wait before someone comes for us? All questions with no answers at this time.\n \n Ah, yes, Golding tells us, everything goes well for a while. But remember the "scar" made by the crashing plane? Something ugly is on this island (but it\'s not the scar). It\'s in the bushes, in the dark, in the depths, in the depths of hearts, and it grows like the malignancy it is.\n \n A blatant revelation of what is about to come occurs when Roger silently and stealthily watches a young\'un, unbeknownst to the little child. All the young\'un is doing is running a stick through the sand, disturbing a crab in a tiny pool of water. Even he imposes control and fear on a helpless creature as Roger boldly picks up a couple of rocks and tosses them the youngster\'s way. He deliberately misses but comes closer with each throw. Next time he will probably hit the young boy, but not yet. This taboo--deliberately and unnecessarily causing pain to one smaller than you--has not been broken--yet.\n \n Although the dance of the spears, the primeval chants, the attack and killing of the pig, then feasting on its flesh, their kill, are shocking acts of savagery, this event is foreshadowed by the seemingly innocent lob of the stones. From a casual incident, but one with eventual intentionality, the ritualistic slaughter is not so far-fetched or surprising. Golding prepares his readers. This is how the chaos of society starts. It begins with one simple disconnect from the rules. It begins in the minds and hearts. Will I do what society expects? Will I follow the rules to keep things running and working? Do I break a rule or two for my own enhancement. Will I feel a power surge if my rock hits that young `un?\n \n Ralph would probably speak of the terror of knowing that rules WILL be broken. He would speak of the utter horror that any rule can be and will be broken and he won\'t live to tell about it. Just ask Piggy.\n \n This novel is the only one I taught over and over during the twelve years I worked with high school seniors. My other choices I would switch around those years, drop some, add some. This one I kept. It is that important. I think of "Lord of the Flies" as a necessary manual for societal behavior and an effort to keep the chaos of evil at bay. \n \n Is it even necessary to ask how many times that rock has been thrown since this novel was published in the 1950\'s? Or how much chaos has imploded so many lives?\n \n Like the way of manuals, some remain in circulation and are deeply read; others fall by the wayside out of disinterest. Some are thrown in the trash. "Lord of the Flies"--what is its current status? And society--how is it doing? Reader, are you a little bit fearful?\n \n'

aS"\nAnne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl tells of a young Jewish girl's experiences through adolescence in the midst of World War II and Hitler's genocide against her people.  On her thirteenth birthday, she was given a  diary in which to write her thoughts and feelings.  She, her family, the  Van Daan family, and Dr. Dussel tried to adjust to life in the Secret  Annexe.  Her diary, which she named Kitty, was written from her heart with  no superficiality.  This makes reading it a great experience. \tShe  discussed in the book many issues prevalent in her life as a Jew.  She  talked about the Zionist movement and the hardships Jews endured in Nazi  Germany.  They could only shop in certain stores designated for Jewish use.   She wrote about her father and sister's fear of deportation, which would  have almost definitely resulted in going to a deadly concentration camp. \t It is a good read because of the way it intertwines childhood and the  Holocaust and speaks of both candidly.  She wrote about her feelings and  encounters with friends and family.  She let out her anger at Hitler and  described the new reforms that made her life much harder.  She thought she  had found a good friend in Kitty.  Little did she know that one day her  story would impact thousands around the world, even if she was only a young  girl.\n"

aS"\nI was skeptical about this album. I did not know what to think of it at first. The more I listened, the more it grew on me. This is an edgy collection of hard-hitting electro-pop songs, made all the more irresistible by their high-octance punk energy and her irrelevant lyrics and attitude. The songs showcase her flair of story-telling, her choice of subject matter is not exactly conventional. The album's title came from an diving experience she had and she was almost bitten by a barracuda. This album also has an empowering, carefree message for young women. This album is going to be successful despite the mixed reviews and negative reactions it has been receiving.\n"

aS'\nI though the Da Vinci Code was a good book. It did have it\'s faults...I don\'t think that it was all that well-written. I also feel like the characters spent most of the book displaying or explainint their characterization rather than just "being themselves." However, it was a very enthralling story. It grabs the reader\'s interest and doesn\'t let go. Anyone who has an interest in art, history, or even cospiracy theories would like this book. I\'m not saying that everything in the book is historical fact...don\'t get me wrong...but some of it is. There is a lot of factual information in the book...especially concerning Leonardo Da Vinci. I would recommend reading the Illustrated Edition, especially for anyone who is unfamiliar with a lot of art. This edition includes photographs of all of the paintings, sculptures, buildings, and drawings that are mentioned in the book. It is extremely helpful in understanding what is being read.\n'

"I have a lot of kids that follow me now, so I have to be responsible to those who listen to my music.

aS"\nI've now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad, and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind.\n \n First the good sides:\n \n This thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages.\n \n The not so good sides:\n \n As has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release.  That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think.  It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means.  The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera.  It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for.  The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider.  Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so.  This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great.  The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist.  If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much.\n \n As a laptop replacement:\n \n The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality.  Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though.  You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks.  That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with.  I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard.\n \n Battery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use.  One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers.  The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw.  This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger.  Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging.\n \n All in all, the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users.  For people who need something to really do a lot of work on, you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs.  Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation.  However, if you're an avid reader, casual gamer, music fan, who doesn't do much more on the web than check a few sites, and e-mail.  This thing is definitely worth considering!  If you're on the fence, nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now, but it is worthy of your consideration if you're thinking you might like a tablet style device.  I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it.  With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we're likely to see some price movement, or a second generation release, so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while.\n \n One final note, the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on.  It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle.  But when you turn it off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible (while it is on the light is bright enough you don't see them fingerprints).  If you are a neat freak, or just hate finger prints on your devices you'll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve!\n \n In conclusion, it's a lot of fun, and I'm not the least bit sorry to have bought one.  It does many things, and over the next months will do many more.  If you think you want one, go play with one, and if you don't want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome.  If you have specific needs that aren't really addressed in this generation or by apple, don't let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one, there are a number of devices coming with great potential, one of those might be a better fit.\n"

aS'\nI purchased this tool to become more familiar with my cycles. Ouch isn\'t something you really want to feel when you use a speculum. It may not be the most comfortable situation but it should not *hurt*. It\'s really appalling how many fake "funny or joke reviews" are on this subject. It\'s sad that a women\'s health tool has to be the subject of objectification or a joke. I truly encourage all the women I know to get more in touch with their cycles and their cervix. Empower yourself! It\'s a beautiful thing. A speculum is a wonderful tool!!  I purchased this to become more familiar with my cycles and to also become more familiar with my cervix. You can tell SO much about ovulation by checking your cervix. When you are TTC, this is invaluable. It\'s a relatively inexpensive tool. \n \n Anyways, this speculum was *not* what I expected at all. One of the blades was much shorter than the other making it impossible to insert. No matter how much lube I used, or how relaxed I was, it wouldn\'t insert itself comfortably. I chose to buy this one instead of plastic for environmental reasons but I regret the decision as I cannot even use it. I have since ordered a pack of plastic speculums and already used one of those. It fit SO much more comfortably. I was hoping I didn\'t have to buy plastic but I did. \n \n The shipper did get the item to me in a timely manner so if you\'d like to try it for yourself, you can count on fast shipping. \n \n Would definitely not make this purchase again based on the ease of use of this speculum. It hurt too much and I have a pretty decent tolerance for discomfort. \n \n (this all may be TMI but what did you expect in a product review for a speculum?)\n'

Only complaint is the speaker volume. In a quiet room there wouldn't be a problem.

aS"\nIf you love 80's cartoon series you are probably very familiar with He-Man, but if not you MUST see this.  It's a terrific television series with enough depth to surpass most current television cartoons.  If you are familiar with He-Man this set is a way better choice than the 10 best episode collection.  The set includes many of the terrific episodes included in the 10 best and has many that finished just out of the top 10 (as voted by fans and supporters of he-man.org).  The cost of this collection is only 60% more than that of the 10-best and contains nearly five times the material.  Special features are great, and you won't get sick of watching several of these episodes over again.  Also, the stories are wholesome and are not seeking chances for clever inuendos like some current cartoon series, so that they are appropriate for young children as well.\n"

aS'\nLet me start off by saying that I never met a Douglas Kennedy book that I didn\'t love!! This book had arrived a few days ago (ordered from the UK because it came out there first) and, each time I passed the table where it was sitting, I actually got a tingle just seeing the name Douglas Kennedy on the cover and knowing that something great was between those covers. \n \n I like to think I discovered Douglas Kennedy all on my own many, many years ago when I read The Big Picture. At that time, whenever anyone asked me to recommend a great book, that\'s the one I told them to read. Kennedy followed up The Big Picture with The Job....another great roller coaster ride of a book. I don\'t know if something changed in his life at that point because all of the following books were very different. They were specifically about women or couples who were going through major rifts in their lives. As far as I\'m concerned, no one can get inside of the head of a woman like Douglas Kennedy can. I wouldn\'t want to be his wife. \n \n Kennedy writes that "All novels are about a crisis and how an individual -- or a set of individuals --negotiates said crises." In Leaving The World, the main character Joan Howard lives in the world of academia having gotten her PhD from Harvard and is now working as a professor at a New England college. I think Kennedy makes her so intellectually superior so that some of the things she does end up making her look more than intellectually challenged. Obviously doomed by her impulses, Jane finds herself mixed up in one predicament after another. It\'s how she deals with her crises that gives this book the depth that Kennedy\'s readers know he will deliver. She cannot stick to anything or anyone and finds herself lost in a world of people who continually leave her. \n \n Until one day she decides that she will leave them. This is where Kennedy shines as he now puts Jane in charge of her own life and her own destiny and where we see shades of the excitement found in The Big Picture seeping through each page. While some people might say this book starts out slowly, they would be right because this is the way Kennedy sets the stage for things to come. He wants his reader to be totally invested in his character before he asks them to understand her. When we first meet Jane, it is in the present moment but, like everyone else, she has a back story and it\'s the understanding of this back story that will eventually help the reader to understand why she does what she does. In the book Kennedy says, "Life can only be lived forwards and understood backwards." And so we really come to understand more and more what is propelling Jane. There are times in the book where I was screaming, "NO Jane...don\'t do it", only to have my words fall on deaf ears. \n \n Jane\'s life is one of ups and downs never seeming to find that happy medium between living and actually being happy doing so. Kennedy says in the book, "Unhappiness isn\'t simply a state of mind; it is also a habit." Reading this book is a journey as Jane tries to break this habit. It\'s another examination of the psyche of a woman by a master storyteller. In the hands of Douglas Kennedy, it becomes an expedition and one I was happy to take. \n \n I know I\'ve quoted Kennedy a lot in this review but some of the things he says in this book had such meaning to me. I leave you with one of the best...."Conscience is the inner voice which warns us that somebody might be looking." Well, I\'m now your conscience looking at you and watching to see if you read this book!!!\n'

aS'\nI am a big fan of politicians who are, well, for the lack of a better phrase, not born with a silver spoon in her/his mouth.  When you have to work to pay for little things others take for granted, e.g. your own education, you have a true sense of what it takes to reach your goals in life.  For this reason, I admire people like Pres. Clinton and Gov. Palin greatly.  Clinton\'s "My Life" is one of my all-time favorite autobiographies.  \n \n As I read through this book, it became clear to me, much like Pres. Clinton, Mrs. Palin is far from a perfect human being and she has not been without fault.  To her credit, she did not try to hide everything in the book.  She admitted to many of the mistakes she made during the campaign and her life in general, and she tried to give a hindsight review of what went wrong and how she should/would have done differently, although I wish she had played less of the blame game in the book overall.  As a political moderate, I can\'t say I always agree with Gov. Palin\'s opinions and stances on different issues, but I respect her because she formed them based on her own personal beliefs and experiences and did not blindedly follow "party leaders".  The book also was Gov. Palin\'s first fair chance to explain some of the controversies that plagued her VP campaign, including the Troopergate, the Couric interview, the pregnancies (both herself and Bristol) and many more stories we never heard.  Whether or not you want to take her words with a grain of salt, it at least is her side of the story that the media never presented us.\n \n All in all, a very good read that took us from her childhood days in Alaska as a tomboy who loved sports and outdoors, to her struggles in early adulthood with her husband and children, and eventually to her glamorous appearance along side Sen. McCain on the campaign trails.  Whether you agree with her politics, I think this book presents much we could learn from her life.\n \n This is my honest review of the book and how much I enjoyed it, not the person or her political positions.  I pre-ordered on Kindle and finished in a little less than two days.\n'

aS"\nI hadn't heard much about Vantage Point before going to see it in the dollar theaters last week, and I must say this film deserved a lot more attention than it seems to have gotten. The concept of the movie (which is hinted at in the title) is what especially makes Vantage Point a compelling and unique film; I won't address the pattern it revolves around directly since it comes as a nice surprise, but the vantage points by which the movie progresses are very entertaining and suspenseful. Just when I thought I had figured out everything about what was going on, I was not even close. Plenty of twists, thrilling action scenes, and surprises make this movie a must-see. The acting is all tremendous as well; my only criticisms would be the tendency of the film to have parts which were incredibly unrealistic. These parts still contributed to the entertaining nature of Vantage Point, however, and so they didn't bother me much. Overall, this movie combines a unique setting with a fascinating plotline to make one solid film. I would rate Vantage Point four and a half of five stars and highly recommend seeing it. One of my favorite movies so far this year.\n"

aS"\nTo begin this review, let me just say that I am a silly romance movie connoisseur. The cheesier they are, the better. Unfortunately, despite the fact that I went into this movie open minded, I didn't really like it that much. I have not read the books so I understand that that might have been my problem. While others had a strong foundation and understanding of the Edward/Bella relationship, the movie made it seem like super puppy love as opposed to the undying forever love that I imagined this story was trying to establish,\n \n To be fair, I kept comparing the romance to Buffy and Angel from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There was so much development to their love (granted it was a tv show so they had more time to create their romance) but I really felt that during this movie, Edward and Bella seemed to fall in love over night... and that may be how love is in high school, but I expected more and deeper interaction. This was also upsetting in light of all the many airy non-dialogue scenes of them looking at each other or holding each other. I thought that time could have been used better. \n \n Edward came off as kinda of weird. Very attractive but WEIRD. The whole storming out of class thing looked more like he had to go to the bathroom than like he was terrified of Bella's unreadability. His awkwardness was especially strange in light of the fact that he turned into a super cool guy when they started going out-- taking her to dinner after saving her from those brutes and walking into school and prom with his arm around her. I can see how people like Jacob better. Despite going through high school so many times, Edward does not seem well-adjusted whereas Jacob seems like a nice cool guy.\n \n I was more interested in the background characters than anything else.  Edward's family seems fantastic. The baseball scene was really fun and cute. The fact that they tried to cook for her also seemed so wonderful. Also, Bella's dad seems great. I hope the story develops their relationship more. \n \n I will probably watch the second movie but if that one still lacks substance rather only devoted to Edward and Bella's longing glances at each other, that will be it for me. I tried.\n"

aS'\nI have used for the past 6-7 months. For the most part it thickens and I have noticed regrowth in some areas. However these are on the crown and my receding hairline. The only thing is, it slightly grows so you can see very minor growth but nothing ever really comes from it. On the crown of my head I have had a bald spot and only in a very specific area did hair growth occur. Other then that I have noticed increase in thickness and growth in the places I already have hair. If you are in the very early stages of hair loss, I think it would be much more effective. However if you are quite away into it, may be better to look at some other options.\n'

aS'\nIn late October, 1991, the commercial swordfishing boat Andrea Gail left Gloucester, Massachusetts, headed for an area just off Nova Scotia known as  the "Flemish Cap."  The weather in the North Atlantic in the fall is always  chancy, but Captain Billy Tyne (played here by George Clooney) had been the  victim of some poor harvests of late, and he needed fish; moreover, he knew  where to find them.  He was also aware of the risks involved at that time  of year.  What he didn\'t know and could not foresee (nor could any  meteorologist have predicted), was that three major storms were about to  converge to form one huge storm, the likes of which comes along only once  in every hundred years or so.  And the course he had set was about to take  him, his boat and crew of five men, right into the middle of it.  Director  Wolfgang Peterson recounts this incident in "The Perfect Storm," a deftly  crafted and intense rendering of the story of the Andrea Gail, and its  encounter with the storm of the century.   \tWhat Peterson did with this  film, the way he tells the story, can be likened to what Melville did with  the novel, "Moby Dick;" as it moves along, he fleshes out the characters  and subtly provides an intimate portrait of what this kind of life is all  about.  He pays such meticulous attention to details, that by the time  you\'re in the middle of the storm, the impact is extraordinary; you know  what this boat is and how it works, you\'ve smelled the fish and the sweat  and the sea, and worked alongside the crew.   You know these people and  what\'s at stake here.  You know the feel of the fishing lines and the  grappling hooks, felt that rush of adrenaline that comes when you hook a  big one, or when a huge wave washes over the deck.  He gives you so much in  this film, puts you in it so completely, that it primes your senses for  whatever\'s to come.  Combine all of this with the best special effects  imaginable, outstanding performances, and a terrific score by John Horner,  and you\'re in for the thrill of a lifetime.\t\t\t \tThe  charismatic Clooney is exemplary here as Tyne, and is able to convey a real  sense of who this man is without resorting to unwarranted theatrics or  bravura.  He simply knows him from the inside out, and it shows in the way  he carries himself, the way he walks and talks, right down to the look in  his eye; the  seasoned professional with all the skill and confidence  required of his job, but a man who is nevertheless also aware of his own  shortcomings.  It\'s a commanding performance with nuance and depth, all  there on the screen, and Clooney makes it real.   Mark Wahlberg is also  outstanding as Bobby Shatford, the rookie fisherman who can\'t stand to be  more than two feet away from the woman he loves, Christina (Diane Lane).   Another notable performance is turned in here by John C. Reilly, who does  an emotional turn as "Murph," the veteran fisherman who is divorced, has a  young son he loves dearly, and lives with the remorse of past mistakes that  ultimately destroyed his marriage. \tRounding out the exceptional  supporting cast are William Fichtner (Sully), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio  (Linda), Allen Payne (Alfred), John Hawkes (Bugsy) and Michael Ironside  (Bobby Brown).  There are thrills and heroics to spare in "The Perfect  Storm," but it\'s also inspiring; once you\'ve seen the Coast Guard in  action, for example, you\'ll never take them for granted again.  What makes  this such a great movie, though, is that it\'s about real people, an  instance of ordinary people getting caught up in extraordinary  circumstances, and Peterson has made them accessible; these are people with  whom anyone in the audience will be able to identify.  This is a powerful,  emotionally charged and unforgettable film; it will take you to places and  you\'ll experience things from the comfort of your seat in the theater (or  on the couch) that most people will never get close to in real life.  And  therein lies the true magic of the cinema; this is one movie you absolutely  do not want to miss.\n'

I laughed out loud at Emma's actions, and really empathized with her, whereas I always wanted to sit Becky down and give her a good talking to.

aS'\nExcellent movie!  Good character development, reasonable premise for the movie, and good acting. The main character\'s wife is a dedicated doctor who refuses to leave a patient in need and the son saving as many as possible when the worst is about to happen.  The Scottish character\'s comments about the question, "Can scotch be burned in the generator?" was great, "....are you mad?  That\'s 12 year old scotch!" and then pulls out a book to find 3 glasses hiding behind it.\n \n As of the writing of this review, there is a class 4 hurricane bearing down on New Orleans, LA and Biloxi, MS.  The idea of massive storms correcting our global warming is feasible.  The inclusion of the frozen mastodon was a nice touch!  Most everyone knows of the stories of instantly frozen mastodons with flowers in their mouths and this movie provided vivid realism of how instant freezing can occur.  My 10 year old son and my mother watched this movie.  The realism and sheer terror of the possibilities went over my son\'s head.  But my 77 year old mother thought it was the best movie she had seen in years.  \n \n I must say, I agree with my mom for once! The Day After Tomorrow is the best movie I have seen in a long time!  \n \n'

aS'\nBioware has a pretty impressive track record for RPGs. Their most famous work to date, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic , garnered almost every "Game of the Year" award in the video game industry back when it was released.\n \n Now a few years later, we get \'Mass Effect\'. A Sci-Fi adventure that at times can seem as if it has endless choices for you to make. A few examples are things such as your character customization options (including gender and specializations), weapon and armor customization, and your "good or evil" path choices.\n \n Actually, boiling it down to Good or Evil is a mistatement. It isn\'t that simple with Mass Effect. You are set out to be a \'hero\', but how you get there is your choice. You can choose to work with the citizens you encounter to get complete your mission and be a Paragon. You can also choose to be a take-no-prisoners type of character and be a Renegade. If neither of those suit you, play it right down the middle a be a balance of both or neither. Your choice.\n \n The story is Bioware\'s best plot ever. If you played the original Knights of the Old Republic, that\'s saying something. I won\'t give anything away, because the story is one of the main selling points of the game.\n \n The combat is simple. In fact, some might find it overly so. However, I think people are missing the point. This isn\'t trying to be the greatest Third Person Shooter ever created. It\'s trying to revolutionize what RPGs can be.\n \n The graphics are beyond stunning. Sometimes you will find yourself staring at your surrondings in awe and completely forget what you were doing. There is a minor buffering issue where all of the textures are loaded a second or two after you regain control of your characters, but it\'s nothing that really detracts from the games overall beauty.\n \n In my opinion, I think Bioware succeeded in once again showing us the true potential of what the RPG genre can put forth. In fact, if there is one RPG out this year that is a must have, Mass Effect is it. Do not hesitate to order because you won\'t regret the purchase.\n'

aS'\nI decided to replace my old "all in one" printer which I was using as a scanner and a photocopying with the Canon LIDE200.   I liked the specification: 4800x4800 dpi and a claimed 11 second scan rate. \n \n The first thing I noticed as I was unpacking the scanner from the box was a mysterious WARNING about unlocking the lid of the scanner.   The scanner was packed with the lid unlocked (as I found out later), and the instructions mentioned to keep the lid locked for travel or extensive handling.  Fair enough, but it made me wonder if I had already done something bad to my scanner (I hadn\'t). \n \n I then installed the software.  I expected big things from Canon here, because generally they are pretty smart about software.   The software, in terms of use, is much better than the software I had for scanning with my old scanner.    The scanner has an "easy" setting that basically just scans at 300DPI without a fuss.    If you want to scan at full resolution, you have to open the "driver" that exposes a page with all the bells and whistles to let you really fine tune your scan and set the highest resolutions.  \n \n All this was fair enough, however I found a few minor disturbing problems with the software.   Firstly, once you\'ve opened the "driver", it\'s not intuitive to figure out how to get back to the "no brainer" mode.   Also, when you want to save your scan, it always seems to default to the scanning library it sets up.  If you override it, it doesn\'t stay "changed".   This is a slight pain.  I always wonder who they hire to test and give feedback, because I always feel like I\'m pointing out what should be the "obvious" to large companies like Canon (actually I really love Canon - so take no offense!). \n \n As far as scanning speed is concerned, the scanner does indeed scan a 300 dpi page in about 11 seconds (that\'s pretty fast folks).  However, the estimate does not include the 3 seconds the software takes to respond to the command to begin scanning (I\'m running a duo core processor - no slouch) and the few seconds it takes to save the image.   All in all, speed is impressive. \n \n Now on to document quality.  I tried scanning a few brochures and to be honest, at 300 DPI I wasn\'t super impressed with the result.   So I went into the "driver" at set the scanning at maximum resolution (4800 x 4800).   You get a pretty good result at that resolution, but by no means was I blown away.   Perhaps more "tweaks" of the driver is needed.   I noticed that the scanner attempts to "improve" the picture (which it does) but some of the detail of the text was a little off (brochure had images and text).  I wondered if the lid of the scanner was making really good contact.  Next time I will add a few pages of plain white paper behind the image and see if it makes a difference. \n \n I tried scanning a printed document, and compared it to a printed document I scanned using my old scanner.   I scanned the image to a PDF and low and behold, a major, major improvement (at 300 DPI). \n \n So, I gave the scanner four "stars".  Why not five?   Well, the software is much easier to use than my old scanner, but still not without a few minor "quirks".    This is a great scanner for scanning documents.  How well it will actually scan and reproduce a photo is still in question, and perhaps I need to learn how to use the driver software better.  I don\'t think I could scan an original photo without seeing some degradation in quality.  \n \n I\'d be interested to hear other people\'s experiences regarding copying photos.   I hope I\'m wrong in my assessment, because I really expected a 4800x4800 scanner to reproduce "dead on" copies of a photo.\n'

aS'\nAvril Lavigne has changed a lot, in my opinion, since "Let Go".  But I think those changes were made for the better.  Not only do her songs have less cheesy lines in them, but you can tell just by looking at her that she is more mature.  I found this album to be a little depressing because there aren\'t too many cheerful, upbeat songs like there were on Let Go, but still a cool pop/rock album!  Here are my ratings for each song:\n \n 1. Take Me Away-5/5.  This song has a hard rock beat, and is somewhat like "Losing Grip", the song that started off Let Go.  It is about just wanting to get away from all the pain and suffering being felt inside.\n \n 2. Together-4/5.  Avril\'s vocals in the chorus have a rather annoingly high pitch, but this song is still a good one.  In this song, Avril talks about not feeling "together" with her boyfriend. \n \n 3. Don\'t Tell Me-5/5.  One of my favorite songs on this album.  It has a rather mature subject, and is not exactly the most appropriate for younger kids.  \n \n 4. He Wasn\'t-3/5.  The "Sk8r Boi" of Under My Skin, "He Wasn\'t" is really upbeat, and the lyrics are kind of cheesy in some parts.  In this song, Avril sings about the boy she likes turning out to be someone completely different from what she thought he would be.\n \n 5. How Does It Feel-3/5.  This song is slow, but Avril\'s vocals sound pretty good in it.  That\'s why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.  It is about wondering how other people view the world.\n \n 6. My Happy Ending-5/5.  Another of my favorites on this album.  It has a great beat, and catchy lyrics.  It is about an "UN-Happy Ending" with a boy.  Note that there is a kind of big cussword in the part after the first chorus.\n \n 7. Nobody\'s Home-4/5.  I guess this is the song I should be talking about the most, since Amazon won\'t let you listen to a clip of it on this album.  It is a kind of sad song about a girl who\'s been misguided, and who is alone and depressed.  The beat is good, and Avril\'s voice sounds nice. \n \n 8. Forgotten-5/5.  This song starts out in an eerie sort of way, then turns into hard rock and loud vocals.  This is yet another of my favorite songs.  It is about, of course, being forgotten and left behind.\n \n 9. Who Knows-3/5.  This song has a good beat, and is about making your dreams come true.\n \n 10. Fall To Pieces-3/5.  This song is slightly better then "Who Knows", in my opinion, although it sounds rather similar to it.  It is a love song, and Avril\'s vocals sound pretty good in it.\n \n 11. Freak Out-5/5.  This song sounds like one that would end a really good movie, or be the favorite on the movie soundtrack.  It has a good beat, and catchy lyrics.  I used to not like it, but yes, it is now ANOTHER of my favorite songs on this album.  It is about letting loose.\n \n 12. Slipped Away-5/5.  This is a sad song Avril wrote about when her grandpa died.  The beat is nice, though slow, the lyrics are good, and Avril\'s vocals sound great.  If you\'re easily depressed/disturbed then you might not like this song, though.\n \n By averaging, I got the overall rating of 4 stars for this album, which is better then the overall rating I got for Let Go.  I would suggest listening to clips of the songs here on Amazon before purchasing, though.\n'

aS'\nI\'m a bit new to the Keys.  My first record of theirs was Attack and Release.  With that record, it only took me two minutes into the first track "All You Ever Wanted" to know that the Keys were my new favorite band.  Likewise, with Brothers- from the first seconds of the first track "Everlasting Light" - I knew I was gonna love this record.  And having owned it now for only about two days, it\'s been in steady, constant rotation.  It\'s a total classic.  Blues, rock, soul, simmer, r&b, roadhouse shakers... man... the Keys just melt it all down into an amazing musical gumbo.  Standouts for me are Sinister Kid, Tighten Up, Next Girl, The Go-Getter, She\'s Long Gone, Ten Cent Pistol, and of course their awesome cover of Isaac Hayes Never Gonna Give You Up.  This whole album is deeeep.  Buy it ya\'ll.\n'

aS"\nSadly, this much-anticipated album is chock full of repetitive formulaic songs (it seems that all McCartney has to do is repeat a word or phrase over and over, and then sets it to music...)  Not up to this star's usual abilities.  Don't bother!\n"

aS"\nAs if there weren't enough reviews of this book, I'll add mine: In a word,  wonderful. The &quot;protagonist&quot; is one Ignatius J. Reilly, a fat,  pompus windbag who is over-educated, but refuses to work, preferring to  stay home and drive his mother nuts while writing his never-ending treastie  on the awfulness of the modern world -- &quot;modern&quot; meaning anything  since early Medieval times! Thanks to his mother running into a building  while under the influence, Ignacious has to go to work. You can just about  imagine the kind of worker he is, versus the kind of worker he really is!  You wouldn't want to leave this guy alone with a typewriter, or even a  hot-dog cart, for a minute.  John Kennedy Toole does not just depict  Ignatius's delusions, but brilliantly depicts everyone else's delusions,  too. His novel shows us that none of us operate in a concrete reality --  our perceptions are deluded because of our beliefs, worldview, past  experiences, etc. This book should be assigned, or at least recommended,  reading for any college course dealing with post-Modern thought.\n"

aS"\nThis book is sure to be loudly denounced and vehemently derided, but coming, as it does, from a member of Clinton's own military security detail, it will most likely never be debunked. Lieutenant Colonel Robert &quot;Buzz&quot; Patterson penned &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; after his retirement because he would never have been able to publish this kind of information while working for the government. &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; is a gripping, yet horrifying read that'll have you realizing how lucky the U.S. was during the eight year Clinton/Gore Administration. One of the most damning charges is that Clinton once lost the &quot;nuclear football,&quot; the suitcase that carries this country's nuclear launch codes. Clinton's response, according to Patterson, was a cavalier, &quot;I'll track'em down guys.&quot; You'll also read about the time in 1998 that Clinton blew off his National Security Advisor so he could finish a round of golf, while stealth-bombers, engines running, their pilots in the cockpits, sat on a Mid-East tarmac  until the cover of darkness was lost and a vital mission against Saddam Hussein was called off. Patterson also gives an entirely new look at the &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; story, with Clinton denying the troops the weaponry they requested, then sending them into harm's way and ultimately blaming the disaster on his Secretary of Defense. &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; is a searing indictment of the Clinton administration from an insider's view. This book deserves to be read by every American!\n"

aS"\nBrush works great but the only part I wasn't 100% pleased with is that I received a bent wooden handle. The long wooden handle has a curve to it if you look down its length. Overall it doesn't affect its performance if you screw the handle in so the curve bends like a camels back down to the broom brush. If you have the curve to the left or the right when your pushing it bends more & is harder to push forward when pushing much sand or gravel away from the cement.\n \n The brush itself works great, some of the bristles fall out here and there but doesn't wear fast overall. If I didn't receive a bent handle I am sure I would have fully approved this product.\n"

aS'\nIf you spend much time driving in unfamiliar territory, especially if you rent cars in big cities, a good portable GPS makes an amazing difference. And the Garmin 255W is the best one I could find in the $250 - $350 range.\n \n First this thing just plain works. I haven\'t had any issues with mine. It was easy to set up and figure out right out of the box, and it\'s easy to use. It never has had trouble getting sufficient signal unlike earlier and cheaper models.\n \n I chose the 255W for several reasons: It uses some of the newest and best maps available. It has one of the more usable touch screens for entering destinations. It\'s fast to acquire satellites. And Garmin almost always comes out on top in reviews--especially in routing.\n \n Ultimately, you buy a car GPS to get you from Point A to Point B as easily and efficiently as possible. And that\'s what the 255W does best. If you\'ve ever had a "Brand X" GPS take you on some strange route that adds 20 minutes to your trip, has you turn the wrong way down a one way road, tell you to turn AFTER you\'ve passed the street, frequently loses the satellite signal, or has old maps missing streets, you know how important this stuff is.\n \n The 255W has a really clear display that\'s easy to see in any light. It\'s small enough to use on foot. The windshield mount works great and it\'s easy to toss in the glovebox when you park. It even tells you the speed limit on most roads. The "points of interest" feature works very well to find places to eat by type of cuisine, gas stations, etc.\n \n The difference between the 255W and 205W is the 255 speaks street names and includes Alaska and Canada. The 205 and 205W will tell you to "turn right in 500 feet" which isn\'t as helpful or obvious as "turn right on Ivy Street in 500 feet". The "W" models are widescreen which makes entering destinations easier due to having a bigger "keyboard" and also lets you see more map area while driving.\n \n All in all this isn\'t the cheapest GPS in its class but it\'s one of the best. My only gripe is you need an expensive add-on to get live traffic data--something that\'s included with the Magellan Roadmate 1430 which is close to the same price. But the Garmin 255W is a better GPS in every other way. \n \n'

aS'\nI can\'t believe its over :( Im not going to go into specifics of my interpretation of the show or why I liked or disliked the ending..I could ramble on all day about that, but for those who complain about all the answers not being revealed, I think we forget why we loved this show in the first place. So many of us stuck with this show for 6 years from day one, and will always hold a special place in our hearts ... It would have been impossible to end something like that with everyone satisfied. It may be "over" but I know at least for me, I\'ll be thinking about this show for a lifetime.\n'

aS"\nI don't care about the looks, I'm just a fan of the music... And I'm not 12 years old, mind you, and neither are many of the other people who found &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; likable -- many adults like Hanson, too. I  don't care how many CDs you have, and I don't care about your life story,  either. You've got to relize something about Hanson and &quot;Middle of  Nowhere&quot;. This was written/co-written and co-produced by the band  Hanson themselves, when Ike was 16, Tay was 14, and when Zac was 11. You  have got to be crazy not to think that these boys (yes, they are boys) are  talented. You have to admit it, even if you don't like their music. What's  more, they play their own instruments. Why don't you go bother BSB or *N  SYNC or something because, unlike the hard working Hanson bros., they don't  write their music, they don't write their lyrics, they don't play  instruments for their music, and their music isn't good anyway. But take  &quot;M.O.N.&quot;:  It's not my favorite, but I really like it a lot. The  songs were written from the band's personal expriences (&quot;With You In  Your Dreams&quot; and &quot;MMMBop&quot;- you just have to listen to the  words) and what teens really feel and think (&quot;Weird&quot;,  &quot;Thinking of You&quot;, ect., ect.). All *N SYNC ever sings about is  breaking up with some girl, still loving that girl, and wanting her back.  One theme. On one of Hanson's very mature songs, &quot;Weird&quot; (which  happens to be my favorite Hanson song), they sing about feeling left out  and wishing someone was there who understood them. I don't care how old you  are, everyone has felt that why or will feel that way or do feel that way.  &quot;Thinking of You&quot; is about a boy with a crush on some girl, but  can't be with her (I guess because he can't tell her how he feels about  her). Everyone feels like that. &quot;With You In Your Dreams&quot; was  written by Hanson alone for their dieing grandmother. I don't care what you  say, these boys DO have talent, even if you think this CD is bad or  good! My favorits: &quot;Weird&quot; (my most fave), &quot;MMMBop&quot;,  &quot;Madeline&quot;, &quot;Yearbook&quot;, and &quot;Look  at You,  Baby&quot;. I really don't like &quot;Thinking of You&quot; and  &quot;Lucy&quot;, but they're okay. The rest of the songs are really  good, too. They don't really sound like the Jackson 5, but some of  Hanson's songs have a 60's and 70's sound to them. Also, &quot;Weird&quot;,  &quot;Yearbook&quot;, &quot;I Will Come To You&quot;, and &quot;With You In  Your Dreams&quot; are very mature and are NOT (I repeat; NOT)  &quot;teeny-bopper&quot;!\n"

aS'\nBritish stage and screen actor Jeremy Irons is a beguiling reader whether sotto voce or thunderous declaration.  His crisply articulate delivery is especially well suited to this contemporary fable reminding us of what is truly important in life. \tSantiago, a  shepherd boy, dreams of treasure hidden in Egypt.  So, he leaves his home in Spain to search for the most precious hoard  imaginable, in other words, he follows his dream. His quest takes him to the markets of  Tangier and across the Egyptian desert to forage among the Pyramids. \tDuring his journey he meets a Gypsy woman, a self proclaimed king, and an Alchemist, all of whom offer Santiago directions.  Listeners do not know what the treasure is that the boy seeks, but they do learn that riches are not found in possessions but rather within our hearts and minds. \tMr. Irons has already been lauded by his peers - he is the winner of an Emmy Award, an Academy Award, and a Tony Award.  This reading will simply add luster to his already stellar accomplishments.\n'

p12751

S' For example: in past games in order to attack you may have been required to press "A" but the Wii replaces this with a simple "shake" of the controller.'

S" It doesn't even matter as to which direction the controller is shaken in either, seeing as the gesture will not match the onscreen motions."

S' The majority of the games on the Wii really only use five different gestures, simply recycled over and over again.'

p12773

S' In several of these games, I found myself repeating missions and levels simply due to the fact that the Wiimote would make my on screen character perform the wrong moves.'

S' This results in lag, delayed moves, incorrect moves, and more.'

S' These reviews seem to have a few things in common: they show very little regard to not only the craftsmanship and genius behind this work, but seem to be written from a jaded aspect that belies someone writing against a deadline and only taking time to listen to the album once (if they even listened that much).'

S" That's my take, at least."

p32450
sS'sen64'

p32452
sS'sen67'
p32453
S' I doubt it is intentional, and it is otherwise completely overshadowed by what is quite an uncharacteristically upbeat, almost saccharine ode from Albarn.'
p32454
sS'sen66'
p32455
S' Listen closely and you\'ll hear a rhythm that lies beneath Coldplay\'s "Viva La Vida" and the song it borrowed heavily from "Foreigner Suite" by Cat Stevens.'
p32456
sS'sen61'
p32457
S"       Many are split on this Lou Reed guest effort, where his sing-song voice takes Albarn's piano-based beatnik ditty for a quick spin."
p32458

p32459
S' But just as soon as you begin to contemplate that we are off to our next song.'
p32460

p32461
S' The song comes pre-loaded with a fully realized chorus and simulated clapping that beckons singing along.'
p32462

p32463
S' Some hail it as the watermark of Plastic Beach, while others decry it as its nadir.'
p32464
sS'sen78'

S' Several minutes of repetition in, you are greeted again by the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble amplified this time with a percussion section that evokes an American college football halftime band performance.'

p32467
S' Mos Def is most definitely a winner on this track.'
p32468
sS'sen76'
p32469
S'       Hated this song at first, due to the repetition of the beat and the rhyme.'
p32470
sS'sen77'
p32471
S' However, keep listening: the lyrics actually change, not in their content, but in their delivery, just as the song itself transforms into something greater than the sum of its parts.'

S" I don't care what he is singing about in this song, I just want to listen and feel his lament."

S" It's why this album, and its creator, are one-of-a-kind."
p32476
sS'sen72'
p32477
S' The beat is seriously sick and haunting at the same time.'
p32478
sS'sen73'
p32479
S" The production sounds as if lifted off a top-flight hip-hop producer's private instrumental songbook, but it is so much more due to Damon's vocals dominating the song."
p32480
sS'sen70'
p32481
S' The song evokes Clint Eastwood with its pseudo-riff on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" theme by Hugo Montenegro.'
p32482
sS'sen71'
p32483
S' The song is beyond phenomenal, and I think this is no coincidence, another 2D solo joint that can just as easily be seen as Damon Albarn as himself.'
p32484

S'       Rumored to be the second video and single from the album, this song is dripping with sinister irony.'
p32486
sS'sen48'
p32487
S' Taken in that light, the promotional video shot for this track by co-creator Jaime Hewlett does an excellent job of immediately engaging the audience and drawing them into Plastic Beach.'

p32502
